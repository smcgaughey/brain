# Steve's Running Goals & Training Philosophy

## Primary Goals (Priority Order)
1. **Maintain healthy, consistent running habit** - injury prevention is #1
2. **Build aerobic base** through low HR training
3. **Build distance** gradually and safely
4. **Speed development** - secondary priority, comes later

## Training Philosophy
- Following "Happy Runner" approach
- Low HR base building (Zone 2: 116-145 bpm)
- Intermittent high HR intervals (Zone 3-4: 145-174 bpm)
- 80-90% of runs should be Zone 2
- One hard workout per week maximum during base building

## Heart Rate Zones
- Zone 1 (Recovery): 0-116 bpm
- Zone 2 (Aerobic Base): **116-145 bpm** ← PRIMARY TRAINING ZONE
- Zone 3 (Tempo): 145-159 bpm
- Zone 4 (Threshold): 159-174 bpm
- Zone 5 (Max): 174+ bpm

## Target Zone 2 Pace
- Estimated: 7:00-7:30/km (11:15-12:00/mile)
- Effort: Conversational, "could run forever" feeling
- Should feel almost embarrassingly slow

## Injury History & Considerations
- **2025 Hood to Coast**: Ran with right hip/groin pain in 95-100°F heat
- Ran slow times (10 min/mile) due to pain and conditions
- Currently rebuilding from this injury
- **Critical**: Need easy miles to rebuild hip/groin resilience

## Long-term Goals
- Marathon (potential)
- Wildwood Trail run in Portland, OR (~30 miles)

## Feedback Preferences
- Wants honest, frank advice
- Track all runs and provide feedback on HR discipline
- Help stay aligned with base-building goals
- Flag when running too hard

## Current Status (January 2026)
- Running 2-3x per week
- Recent runs averaging Zone 3-4 (too hard for base building)
- Need to slow down significantly to stay in Zone 2
- Recently sick (elevated HR expected)
- Using Nike Vomero 18 shoes

## Recommended Weekly Structure
- 3-4 runs/week in Zone 2 (easy, conversational)
- 1 interval/tempo session with Zone 3-4 efforts
- 1 optional Zone 1-2 recovery run
- Watch HR religiously - slow down if it creeps above 145 bpm

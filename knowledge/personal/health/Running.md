# Steve's Running Goals & Training Philosophy

## Primary Goals (Priority Order)
1. **Maintain healthy, consistent running habit** - injury prevention is #1
2. **Build aerobic base** through low HR training
3. **Build distance** gradually and safely
4. **Speed development** - secondary priority, comes later

## Training Philosophy
- Following David Roche "Happy Runner" approach
- 80/20 polarized training (80% easy, 20% hard)
- Low HR base building (Zone 1-2)
- Avoid "grey zone" moderate efforts
- One hard workout per week maximum during base building

## Lactate Threshold
- **LTHR: 168 bpm** (established June 5, 2025 — 26-min treadmill effort at 7:30/mile)
- All zones derived from this LTHR value

## Heart Rate Zones (LTHR-Based)
- Zone 1 (Recovery): < 139 bpm (<83% LTHR) — Easy runs, warm-up/cool-down
- Zone 2 (Aerobic Base): **139-155 bpm (83-92% LTHR)** — PRIMARY TRAINING ZONE
- Zone 3 (Tempo): 156-163 bpm (93-97% LTHR) — Race pace sustainability
- Zone 4 (Threshold): 164-172 bpm (98-102% LTHR) — Lactate threshold work
- Zone 5 (VO2max): 173+ bpm (103%+ LTHR) — Hard intervals, neuromuscular

## David Roche Pace Zones (Aligned to HR)
- Zone 1 (Easy): 9:15-9:45/mile — Conversational, aerobic base
- Zone 2 (Moderate): 8:45-9:10/mile — Comfortably hard, sustainable
- Zone 3 (Threshold): 8:15-8:35/mile — Lactate threshold, race pace
- Zone 4 (VO2): 7:45-8:10/mile — Hard intervals, neuromuscular power
- Zone 5 (Neuromuscular): Sub-7:45/mile — All-out sprints

## Practical Training Guidelines
- Easy runs: Stay below 155 bpm (Zone 1-2)
- If HR creeps above 155 on easy days, slow down or walk hills
- Tempo/race pace work: 156-163 bpm (Zone 3)
- Threshold intervals: 164-172 bpm (Zone 4)
- Speed work: 173+ bpm (Zone 5) — sparingly

## Injury History & Considerations
- **2025 Hood to Coast**: Ran with right hip/groin pain in 95-100°F heat
- Ran slow times (10 min/mile) due to pain and conditions
- Currently rebuilding from this injury
- **Critical**: Need easy miles to rebuild hip/groin resilience

## Long-term Goals
- Marathon (potential)
- Wildwood Trail run in Portland, OR (~30 miles)

## Feedback Preferences
- Wants honest, frank advice
- Track all runs and provide feedback on HR discipline
- Help stay aligned with base-building goals
- Flag when running too hard

## Current Status (February 2026)
- Running 2-3x per week
- Rebuilding post-HTC with focus on base building
- Using Nike Vomero 18 shoes
- Coros Pace 3 HR monitor watch

## Recommended Weekly Structure
- 3-4 runs/week in Zone 1-2 (easy, conversational, < 155 bpm)
- 1 interval/tempo session with Zone 3-4 efforts
- 1 optional Zone 1 recovery run
- Watch HR religiously - slow down if it creeps above 155 bpm on easy days

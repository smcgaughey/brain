- Four coherent research themes

### Risks
- Currently below median, need strong Q1-Q2 2026
- Dependent on ~65% acceptance rate
- Some early papers are middle-author positions

## CV GENERATION

When you need a formatted CV, ask Claude:

> "Search my brain for all research files and generate a CV listing publications by status (Published, Accepted, Under Review, In Preparation). Include journal, author position, and theme for each."

Or for specific sections:

> "List all my first-author and senior-author papers from my research files"

> "Summarize my service contributions for my P&T portfolio"

This ensures the CV always reflects current file contents without manual sync.

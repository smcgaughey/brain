**Status:** Manuscript draft complete with all sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References)
**Key Findings:** 
- ITT: 6.5% vs 7.5% return rate (aOR 0.91, p=0.503 - non-significant)
- As-treated: 1.5% absolute risk reduction in contacted patients (5.9% vs 7.4%, NNT=67)

- NEJM publication provides quality signal
- Four coherent research themes show depth and breadth

### Factors Creating Uncertainty
- Currently below median, need strong Q1-Q2 2026 performance
- Dependent on ~65% acceptance rate in pipeline
- NEJM Perspectives may carry less weight than original research
- Some early papers are middle-author positions

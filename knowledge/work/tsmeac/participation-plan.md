# TSMEAC Trauma Subcommittee — Participation Plan
## Steve McGaughey, MD | Pediatric Physician Representative
### Updated: February 10, 2026

## Current Position Assessment

Steve is ~9 months into a 4-year term. He has attended 3-4 meetings. He is still in orientation mode — learning the structure, the players, and the current workstreams. This is appropriate, but Q2 2026 (May, in-person) should mark a shift toward more active contribution.

## Strategic Priorities (Q1-Q2 2026)

### 1. Build the EMSC Bridge
**Goal:** Become the de facto liaison between the EMSC Advisory Committee and the Trauma Subcommittee.

**Why:** These two bodies have overlapping mandates (pediatric readiness, pediatric transfers, pediatric data) but no formal connection. Steve's seat is the natural bridge.

**Actions:**
- Connect with Rachel Ford (EMSC program manager) — understand current EMSC initiatives, get on their distribution list, attend an EMSC meeting as an observer if possible
- Learn the Peds Ready EMS program details — which agencies are participating, what the standards require, how this maps to trauma system needs
- Identify 1-2 specific EMSC outputs (e.g., pediatric readiness assessment data, Peds Ready EMS criteria) that should be referenced in Trauma Subcommittee work

### 2. Understand the Regional Structure
**Goal:** Understand how ATABs work (and how REMSABs will work) well enough to advocate for pediatric considerations at the regional level.

**Why:** Steve's institutional experience is OHSU/Region 1, but his role requires statewide perspective. The ATAB→REMSAB transition is happening now, which means there's an opportunity to embed pediatric considerations in the new regional structure from the start.

**Actions:**
- Email Stella Rausch-Scott to understand ATAB 1 operations and the REMSAB transition timeline
- Ask whether REMSABs will have pediatric representation or pediatric readiness reporting requirements
- Learn what other subcommittee members (especially those in regions 3, 5, 7, 9) see as pediatric care gaps in their areas

### 3. Join a Workgroup
**Goal:** Embed between quarterly meetings by joining one of the two active workgroups.

**Recommendation:** The **Trauma Transfers workgroup** (led by Megan Lundeberg) is the highest-yield option for pediatric impact. Pediatric transfers are disproportionately complex — destination decisions, transport team capabilities, stabilization at referring facilities. This is where Steve's OHSU receiving-center perspective is most directly useful.

**Alternative:** The OTR integration workgroup (led by Jeremy Buller) matters for ensuring pediatric data capture, but the transfers workgroup has more immediate policy implications.

**Timeline:** Volunteer at the Q2 2026 meeting (May, in-person) at the latest.

### 4. Develop Subject Matter Fluency
**Goal:** Be able to speak concretely about pediatric trauma system gaps in Oregon, not just in general terms.

**Actions:**
- Review the OTR biennial report (2023-2024) when published Q1 2026 — look for pediatric-specific data
- Get briefed by Matt Hansen and Sunhee Chung on OHSU pediatric trauma volume, transfer patterns, and known pain points
- Familiarize with ACS pediatric trauma verification criteria and the National Pediatric Readiness Project assessment tool
- Understand NEMSQA Pediatrics measures (especially Peds-03b on weight documentation that Albert Ramon/OHSU is working on)

## Longer-Term (Q3 2026 - Q4 2026)

- Identify one concrete recommendation or position to bring to the subcommittee (e.g., pediatric readiness metrics in hospital trauma designation standards)
- Build relationships with members outside Region 1 — especially Anna LaRosa (Region 9, Ontario) and Willy Foster (Region 3, coast) who represent the areas with the biggest pediatric access challenges
- Coordinate with Jessica Bailey (pediatric physician on TSMEAC) on messaging so recommendations flow consistently from subcommittee up through TSMEAC

## Key Relationships to Develop

| Person | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Rachel Ford | EMSC Program Manager | Primary contact for all pediatric readiness work at OHA |
| Stella Rausch-Scott | Committees Coordinator | Administrative questions, ATAB/REMSAB structure |
| Megan Lundeberg | Trauma Transfers workgroup lead | Natural workgroup partner |
| Jessica Bailey | Pediatric physician on TSMEAC | Coordinate pediatric messaging up the chain |
| Matt Hansen | OHSU peds trauma liaison | Subject matter support |
| Sunhee Chung | OHSU peds EMS director | Subject matter support |
| Albert Ramon | OHSU/PPN QI researcher | Pediatric EMS data/quality work |

# TSMEAC Trauma Subcommittee — Meeting Notes
## February 10, 2026 (Q1 2026, Virtual)

### Key Observations & Takeaways

**ATAB → REMSAB Transition**
- Oregon EMS is transitioning from ATABs (Area Trauma Advisory Boards) to REMSABs (Regional EMS Advisory Boards)
- ATABs were trauma-focused regional bodies; REMSABs will have a broader EMS scope (trauma + cardiac + stroke + behavioral health + general EMS coordination)
- REMSABs are scheduled to start in 2026 per the EMS Board Handbook org chart
- This is part of HB 4081 (2024) EMS Modernization — the new structure consolidates regional advisory functions under the EMSAB
- **Open question:** How does the ATAB 1 (Portland metro) currently operate, and will the REMSAB replace it or absorb it? Does ATAB 1 meet independently?

**EMSC / Peds Ready EMS**
- The EMSC Peds Ready EMS program (launched May 2025) sets standards for EMS transport agency pediatric readiness
- This is a voluntary recognition program — 6 agencies recognized so far
- Relevant to trauma subcommittee work because it directly addresses prehospital pediatric capability

**Steve's Structural Understanding (still developing)**
- The Trauma Subcommittee is one of three specialty subcommittees under TSMEAC
- EMSC Advisory Committee is a separate parallel body under the EMSAB — NOT under TSMEAC
- There is no formal bridge between EMSC work and the Trauma Subcommittee
- Steve's role naturally sits at that intersection — he can import EMSC's pediatric readiness work into trauma system discussions
- Steve's experience is institutionally anchored at OHSU (ATAB Region 1), but his role requires statewide perspective across all regions

### Questions Generated

1. **For Stella Rausch-Scott or Rachel Ford:** Does ATAB 1 meet independently of the Trauma Subcommittee? What does participation look like at the regional level?
2. **For Stella/Rachel:** As the pediatric representative, how do I best fit into the ATAB/REMSAB process? I sit across all regions topically but only have institutional experience in Region 1.
3. **For Rachel Ford specifically:** How can I become more integrated into the pediatric readiness work that EMSC is doing? What's the best way to stay informed and contribute?

**Re: ATAB/REMSAB structure and regional participation**

Hi Stella,

I'm Steve McGaughey — I hold the pediatric physician seat on the TSME Trauma Subcommittee. I have a couple of questions that came out of today's meeting that I'm hoping you can help me with or point me to the right person.

First, regarding the regional structure: Does ATAB Region 1 currently meet independently? I'm listed in Region 1 (OHSU), but I'm not sure whether I should be plugged into regional meetings or activities in addition to the statewide subcommittee.

Second, with the transition from ATABs to REMSABs, I'm trying to understand what that will look like practically. My role on the Trauma Subcommittee is statewide, but my institutional experience is limited to OHSU/Region 1. As the pediatric representative, I'm thinking about how to bring a statewide pediatric perspective rather than just a Region 1 perspective. Is there a way to get oriented to how the regional boards operate and how the REMSAB transition will unfold?

Lastly, I'd like to become more connected to the EMSC / pediatric readiness work that Rachel Ford's team is doing. It seems like there's significant overlap between their work (Peds Ready EMS, the Pediatric Readiness Program) and what the Trauma Subcommittee is working on with hospital accreditation standards and transfers. Is there a mechanism for cross-committee coordination, or is the best approach just for me to reach out to Rachel directly?

Thanks for your help — I appreciate the support you and the EMS Program staff provide to the committees.

## Email 2: To Rachel Ford
**Re: Connecting EMSC pediatric readiness work with the Trauma Subcommittee**
**To:** rachel.l.ford@oha.oregon.gov

Hi Rachel,

I'm Steve McGaughey — I serve as the pediatric physician representative on the TSME Trauma Subcommittee. I wanted to introduce myself and explore how to better connect the work your team is doing in EMSC with what the Trauma Subcommittee is working on.

A few things specifically:

The Trauma Subcommittee is working on hospital accreditation standards as part of EMS modernization, and there's an active workgroup on trauma transfers. Both of these have obvious pediatric dimensions, and I want to make sure I'm bringing informed perspectives from what EMSC already has in place rather than reinventing the wheel. I'd love to understand how the Peds Ready EMS program standards relate to what the Trauma Subcommittee might recommend for trauma center designation criteria.

I'm also trying to understand the Pediatric Readiness Program better — specifically, what data exists on hospital ED pediatric readiness across Oregon, and whether there are known gaps that should be informing trauma system planning.

Would you be open to a brief call or meeting at some point? I don't need anything urgent — I'm trying to build the right foundation so that when pediatric issues come up in the Trauma Subcommittee, I'm well-informed about what EMSC is already doing and what gaps remain.

I'd also be interested in attending an EMSC Advisory Committee meeting as an observer if that's possible. Let me know if that's something I should coordinate through you or through Stella.

Thanks,

Steve McGaughey, MD

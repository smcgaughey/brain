## Email 1: To Stella Rausch-Scott — ✅ SENT 2/10/2026
**Subject:** Getting oriented — questions from the pediatric physician seat on the Trauma Subcommittee
**To:** stella.m.rausch-scott@oha.oregon.gov

Hi Stella,

I'm Steve McGaughey — I hold the pediatric physician seat on the TSME Trauma Subcommittee. I'm reaching out because I'd appreciate some help getting better oriented to my role and how to be a more effective member.

I'll be honest — I'm relatively new to statewide committee work, and while I've been attending meetings since May 2025, I still feel like I'm catching up on a lot of structural and institutional knowledge that other members have built over years. I'm committed to this four-year term and want to contribute meaningfully, not just attend quarterly meetings, but I'm finding the learning curve steeper than I expected. I have a few specific questions, but I'd also welcome any general guidance you have on how newer members can get up to speed.

**Understanding the regional structure:**
Does ATAB Region 1 currently meet independently? I'm listed in Region 1 (OHSU), but I'm not sure whether I should be participating in regional meetings or activities in addition to the statewide subcommittee. And with the transition to REMSABs, I'm trying to understand what that will look like practically — is there a timeline or overview document I can review?

**Finding my place as the pediatric representative:**
My institutional experience is at OHSU in Region 1, but my seat is supposed to bring a statewide pediatric perspective. I'm not sure how to bridge that gap effectively. Are there ways to get exposure to what's happening in other regions — attending other regional meetings, connecting with members from other areas, or reviewing regional reports?

**Getting more involved between meetings:**
I know there are active workgroups (OTR integration, Trauma Transfers). What's the process for joining one? Is there other inter-meeting work I should be aware of — document review, comment periods, informal coordination — that I might be missing?

**Connecting with EMSC:**
There seems to be significant overlap between the EMSC program's pediatric readiness work (Peds Ready EMS, the Pediatric Readiness Program) and what the Trauma Subcommittee is working on with hospital accreditation standards and transfers. Is there a formal mechanism for cross-committee coordination, or should I just reach out to Rachel Ford directly?

**General orientation:**
Is there anything beyond the handbook that you'd recommend for a newer member trying to get up to speed — past meeting minutes, background documents on current workstreams, or anyone you'd suggest I connect with? I want to make sure I'm not missing resources that are already available.

I appreciate your patience with the long list of questions. I know your role supporting all these committees keeps you busy, and I'm grateful for the help. If it's easier to cover some of this on a short call rather than over email, I'm happy to do that too.

Thanks,

Steve McGaughey, MD
OHSU

## Email 2: To Rachel Ford — 🔲 ON HOLD (waiting for Stella's response)
**Subject:** Connecting EMSC pediatric readiness work with the Trauma Subcommittee
**To:** rachel.l.ford@oha.oregon.gov

Hi Rachel,

I'm Steve McGaughey — I serve as the pediatric physician representative on the TSME Trauma Subcommittee. I wanted to introduce myself and explore how to better connect the work your team is doing in EMSC with what the Trauma Subcommittee is working on.

A few things specifically:

The Trauma Subcommittee is working on hospital accreditation standards as part of EMS modernization, and there's an active workgroup on trauma transfers. Both of these have obvious pediatric dimensions, and I want to make sure I'm bringing informed perspectives from what EMSC already has in place rather than reinventing the wheel. I'd love to understand how the Peds Ready EMS program standards relate to what the Trauma Subcommittee might recommend for trauma center designation criteria.

I'm also trying to understand the Pediatric Readiness Program better — specifically, what data exists on hospital ED pediatric readiness across Oregon, and whether there are known gaps that should be informing trauma system planning.

Would you be open to a brief call or meeting at some point? I don't need anything urgent — I'm trying to build the right foundation so that when pediatric issues come up in the Trauma Subcommittee, I'm well-informed about what EMSC is already doing and what gaps remain.

I'd also be interested in attending an EMSC Advisory Committee meeting as an observer if that's possible. Let me know if that's something I should coordinate through you or through Stella.

Thanks,

Steve McGaughey, MD
OHSU

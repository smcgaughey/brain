## Project Summary

Cross-sectional analysis of 153 adolescents with suicidal ideation presenting to two Portland, Oregon sites (OHSU Emergency Department and Unity Center for Behavioral Health) between January 2022-December 2024. Study examines psychiatric medication prescribing patterns, specifically characterizing whether PCP prescribing occurs in contexts of psychiatrist availability versus unavailability. Manuscript format: Academic Pediatrics Brief Report (1,500-2,000 words). **Novel finding:** First study to distinguish PCP prescribing that occurs WITHOUT identified psychiatrists (66.1% of PCP prescriptions - workforce gap) from PCP prescribing that occurs WITH identified psychiatrists available (33.9% - coordination gap), revealing need for dual intervention strategies.

## Notes

### Statistical Methods & Key Findings

**Study Design:** Cross-sectional descriptive analysis, secondary analysis of baseline data from parent longitudinal cohort study

**Sample:** N=153 adolescents with suicidal ideation
- **Sites:** OHSU Emergency Department (39.2%, n=60) + Unity Center for Behavioral Health (60.8%, n=93)
- **Study period:** January 2022 - December 2024
- **On medications:** 71.9% (110/153)
- **Has identified psychiatrist:** 36.6% (56/153)
- **Has identified therapist:** 75.8% (116/153)

**Primary Analysis:** Prescriber type stratified by psychiatrist availability
- Chi-square test comparing PCP prescribing rates: p<0.001
- 95% confidence intervals calculated using binomial test
- Fisher's exact test for medication complexity: p=0.001

**Secondary Analyses:**
- Treatment gap analysis (medications vs therapist engagement)
- Medication risk patterns (benzodiazepines, high-complexity regimens)
- Demographic comparisons (gender, race/ethnicity, site, insurance) - no significant differences found

### Methodological Strengths

1. **Two-site design** strengthens generalizability (academic ED + independent psychiatric hospital)
2. **Novel "two contexts" framework** - first to distinguish PCP prescribing WITH vs WITHOUT psychiatrist availability
3. **Rigorous statistical validation** - all statistics traced back to documented R analysis code
4. **Comprehensive medication complexity analysis** - standard vs high-complexity vs benzodiazepines
5. **Treatment gap quantification** - identifies both workforce gaps (no psychiatrist) and coordination gaps (psychiatrist available but PCP still prescribing)
6. **Appropriate statistical power** for primary comparisons (n=110 on medications, n=57 without psychiatrist, n=53 with psychiatrist)

### Limitations Acknowledged

1. **Geographic scope:** Limited to two Portland, Oregon sites - may not generalize to regions with different psychiatrist availability
2. **Cross-sectional design:** Cannot assess longitudinal outcomes or temporal changes in prescribing patterns
3. **Missing data:** 3.6% unknown prescribers after chart review (reduced from 8.2%)
4. **Sample size:** Traditional Medicaid group too small (n=5) for insurance stratification
5. **No outcomes data:** Cannot determine whether PCP-prescribed patients had better/worse outcomes than psychiatrist-prescribed
6. **Documentation limitations:** Prescriber identification relies on patient report and medical record documentation

### Positioning Against Prior Work

**Previous literature established:**
- PCPs prescribe to 70% of children receiving mental health pharmacotherapy nationally (Anderson 2015)
- Significant child/adolescent psychiatrist workforce shortages (McBain 2019, Thomas 2009)
- 31% of adolescent suicide decedents received care exclusively from PCPs without specialty involvement (Fontanella 2020)

**Our contribution:**
- **First study** to quantify PCP prescribing in two distinct clinical contexts (WITH vs WITHOUT psychiatrist)
- Reveals **dual mechanisms** requiring different interventions: workforce expansion (for 67.7% occurring without psychiatrist) AND care coordination (for 32.3% occurring with psychiatrist available)
- Demonstrates **no demographic disparities** in PCP prescribing patterns (systemic workforce challenge, not access inequity)
- Shows **appropriate complexity distribution** (PCPs refer complex cases to specialists, p=0.001)
- Identifies **concerning benzodiazepine prescribing** by PCPs (63.6%), despite guidelines not recommending as first-line

### Suggested Peer Reviewers

1. **James Green, MD** (Duke University) - Published in Academic Pediatrics on psychiatric comanagement models
2. **Louis Vernacchio, MD, MSc** (Boston Children's Hospital) - Published in Academic Pediatrics 2025 on PCP SSRI prescribing patterns
3. **Benjamin Horwitz, MD, PhD** (Academic Pediatrics editorial board) - Health services research focus

### Word Count Strategy

**Target:** 1,500-2,000 words (Brief Report format)
**Current:** ~1,950 words (within limit)
**Buffer:** 50 words remaining

**If revisions require cuts:**
- Trim Discussion section (currently longest)
- Maintain Introduction at 3 paragraphs
- Keep Results concise (4 subsections)
- Preserve key findings and statistics

### Manuscript Specifications

**Format:** Academic Pediatrics Brief Report
- **Abstract:** 247 words (under 250 limit)
- **Main text:** ~1,950 words (1,500-2,000 limit)
- **References:** 15 (under 25 limit)
- **Tables:** 1 (Patient Characteristics)
- **Figures:** 2 (Prescriber by Psychiatrist Availability, Medication Complexity)

**Keywords:** Adolescent, Suicidal Ideation, Primary Care, Psychiatry, Mental Health Services, Prescribing Patterns

**What's New Box (40 words):** "Among high-risk adolescents with suicidal ideation, primary care physicians prescribed psychiatric medications to 56% of those on medications, with prescribing occurring in two distinct contexts: without identified psychiatrists (66% of PCP prescriptions) and despite psychiatrist availability (34%), suggesting needs for both workforce expansion and care coordination improvement."

### Journal Selection Rationale

**Why Academic Pediatrics (Primary Target):**
1. **Perfect fit:** Health services research is their specialty
2. **Descriptive focus:** Characterizing clinical care patterns = their wheelhouse
3. **Two-site design:** More acceptable than at higher-tier journals
4. **Word count:** 1,500-2,000 words matches Brief Report format exactly
5. **Higher acceptance:** ~85% vs 70% for Journal of Adolescent Health
6. **No APC:** Free submission (hybrid journal)
7. **Portfolio building:** Already submitted Nuts & Bolts article there
8. **Reasonable turnaround:** 6-8 weeks to first decision

**Backup Strategy:**
- **Tier 2:** Journal of Adolescent Health (if rejected, revise to emphasize adolescent health policy angle)
- **Tier 3:** Clinical Pediatrics (if both reject, reframe for PCP clinical practice audience)

### Special Considerations

**Co-Author Management:**
- Dr. Sheridan provided feedback January 21 (small, easy to integrate)
- Three new middle authors invited: Nithin Ravi, Monica Saladik, Laura Waagmeester
- All co-authors have until January 26 for feedback
- Final approval required from Dr. Sheridan before submission

**Figures/Tables Specifications:**
- **Table 1:** Patient Characteristics (demographic + clinical characteristics)
- **Figure 1:** Stacked bar chart showing prescriber distribution by psychiatrist availability (p<0.001)
- **Figure 2:** Grouped bar chart showing medication complexity distribution (p=0.001)
- All figures use color palette: Cornflower Blue (PCP), Sage Green (Psychiatrist), Mustard (ED), Light Blue (Unknown)

**Manuscript Formatting:**
- Title page with all author affiliations
- Blinded manuscript (if required by Academic Pediatrics)
- Line numbers and page numbers (add in Word)
- References formatted per journal style
- Table footnotes and abbreviations defined

**Data Cleaning Notes:**
- Site identification: PR0 prefix = OHSU ED, SOL prefix = Unity Psychiatric
- Insurance categories: Medicaid/OHP grouped (CCO, Molina, CareOregon, Trillium, Advanced Health), Private grouped (Kaiser, Providence, Moda, Aetna, Cigna, Regence, Blue Cross, PacificSource, UMR, United, ODS)
- Gender variable: Uses GENDER_CLEANED (standardized variable)
- Medication complexity: Standard (single SSRI/SNRI) vs High (multiple agents, mood stabilizers requiring monitoring, antipsychotics requiring cardiometabolic monitoring)
- Benzodiazepines: Separately classified as high-risk (lack of efficacy/safety evidence in controlled trials, not recommended as first-line per AACAP guidelines)

### Revision History

**Version 1 (January 9-15, 2026):**
- Initial draft completed
- Single-center described
- Insurance analysis included (trending p=0.08)
- 56.4% PCP prescribing rate
- Unknown prescribers: 8.2%

**Version 2 (January 16, 2026):**
- Corrected to "two-site" study
- Removed insurance analysis (underpowered)
- Distributed to co-authors
- Created reMarkable-optimized PDF for Dr. Sheridan

**Version 3 (January 21, 2026 - CURRENT):**
- Updated statistics after identifying 5 unknown prescribers
- 59.1% PCP prescribing (up from 56.4%)
- Unknown reduced to 3.6%
- Incorporated Dr. Sheridan feedback
- Enhanced discussion sections per co-author comments
- All figures regenerated with updated data

### Confidence Level & Success Metrics

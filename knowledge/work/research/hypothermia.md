## Project Summary

Single-center, 5-year retrospective chart review (2018-2023) examining hypothermic infants ≤60 days presenting to an academic tertiary pediatric emergency department. Study characterizes the epidemiology, clinical features, and temperature-stratified risk of serious bacterial infections (SBI) and invasive bacterial infections (IBI) in this population. Novel finding: 0% IBI rate in the 36.0-36.5°C temperature range compared to 1.7% in infants <36.0°C. Manuscript format: Original research article following JEM structured format with emphasis on temperature stratification findings and clinical implications for emergency medicine practice.

## Current Status

Manuscript under review at Journal of Emergency Medicine following previous rejection from American Journal of Emergency Medicine (AJEM). Awaiting editorial decision. Statistical validation completed using R scripts to verify all manuscript claims against raw dataset, including Fisher's exact test comparisons (p=0.29) for SBI rates between temperature groups.

## Key Decisions

- **June 2025**: Shifted manuscript focus from clinical pathway development to epidemiological characterization with temperature stratification analysis. Determined that pathway development methodology (expert consensus without formal Delphi or IOM standards) was not sufficiently rigorous for pathway-focused manuscript.

- **June 2025**: Identified novel finding of 0% IBI in 36.0-36.5°C temperature range as primary scientific contribution. Repositioned manuscript to emphasize this temperature stratification pattern rather than pathway derivation.

- **December 2025**: Completed comprehensive statistical validation of all manuscript claims using custom R scripts. Verified demographic comparisons, SBI/IBI rates by temperature group, and Fisher's exact test results.

- **January 2026**: Submitted to Journal of Emergency Medicine with structured abstract and JEM-specific formatting (separate Limitations subheading, Article Summary section, emergency medicine terminology).

## Notes

### Study Design & Population
- **Inclusion**: Infants ≤90 days with temperature ≤36.5°C (documented or reported)
- **Primary analysis**: Focused on ≤60 days subset (n=833)
- **Total cohort**: 846 infants <90 days
- **Disposition**: 371 (44.5%) admitted, 462 (55.5%) discharged
- **Evaluated subset**: 273 infants who received diagnostic workup (blood/urine/CSF cultures)
- **Temperature definition**: Hypothermia ≤36.5°C with substratification at ≤36.4°C and <36.0°C

### Key Findings
- **Overall SBI/IBI rate**: 11/273 evaluated infants (4.0%); 11/833 total cohort (1.3%)
- **SBI/IBI distribution**: 9 UTIs (81.8%), 2 bacteremia (18.2%), 0 meningitis (0%)
- **Novel temperature stratification finding**: 
  - 0% IBI (0/155) in 36.0-36.5°C range
  - 1.7% IBI (2/118) in <36.0°C range
  - Fisher's exact test p=0.29 (not statistically significant but clinically suggestive)
- **Clinical presentation**: All 11 SBI/IBI cases were symptomatic
- **Safety outcome**: No SBI/IBI cases in 72-hour return visits
- **Age stratification**: Analysis conducted across groups ≤7 days, 8-21 days, 22-28 days, 29-60 days, 61-90 days

### Statistical Methods
- Descriptive statistics with means (95% CI), medians (IQR)
- Fisher's exact test for categorical comparisons (temperature groups, evaluated vs not evaluated)
- Student t-test for continuous variables (large samples, no extreme skew)
- Clopper-Pearson exact 95% CIs for proportions
- Rule of three for zero-event outcomes (0% IBI in 36.0-36.5°C)
- Two-tailed tests with α = 0.05
- STROBE reporting guidelines followed

### Methodological Strengths
- Largest single-center cohort (833 patients ≤60 days) compared to prior studies (68-360 patients)
- Comprehensive age stratification using AAP febrile infant framework
- Novel temperature stratification analysis revealing differential IBI risk
- Rigorous statistical validation with custom R scripts verifying all manuscript claims
- Detailed clinical data including presenting symptoms, laboratory values, outcomes

### Limitations Acknowledged
- Single-center, retrospective design limits generalizability
- Selection bias in diagnostic evaluation decisions (only 273/833 evaluated)
- Limited long-term follow-up data for discharged patients
- Small sample size for IBI subgroup analysis (n=2 cases)
- Potential observer bias in clinical assessments
- Temperature measurement methodology variations
- Lack of standardized evaluation protocol

### Positioning Against Prior Work
- Addresses evidence scarcity crisis: Delaney systematic review found only 4 eligible studies from 1,242 articles
- Responds to practice variation documented by Ramgopal studies across 32 PHIS hospitals (CSF studies 14-70%, inflammatory markers 8-88%, antibiotics 56-92%)
- Lower SBI rate (1.3%) than multicenter studies but consistent with other single-center reports
- Novel contribution: First study to analyze IBI risk by specific temperature stratification
- Contrasts with febrile infant literature where extensive pathways exist (AAP guidelines)

### Journal Selection Rationale
- **JEM selection**: Appropriate scope for single-center observational studies; structured abstract format; emphasis on emergency medicine practice implications; accepts novel clinical findings that inform risk stratification
- **AJEM rejection**: Previous submission unsuccessful; manuscript repositioned with stronger focus on temperature stratification findings rather than pathway development

### IRB Status
- IRB approval obtained from academic institution
- Retrospective chart review with appropriate ethics oversight
- No patient consent required for retrospective review

### Funding & Conflicts
- No external funding
- No conflicts of interest

### Special Considerations
- **Word count strategy**: Maintained concise reporting per JEM preferences (~4,000-5,000 words typical for original research)
- **Figure/table strategy**: Emphasized temperature stratification findings with clear 2×2 contingency tables showing 0% IBI in 36.0-36.5°C range
- **Statistical transparency**: Created exportable CSV files with contingency tables and p-values for reviewer verification
- **Revision history**: Manuscript evolved from pathway development focus to epidemiological characterization based on methodological rigor assessment

### Key Literature References
- Delaney et al. systematic review (4 eligible studies)
- Ramgopal et al. practice variation studies and outcomes research
- Money et al. prediction model for SBI in hypothermic infants
- Perry, Wood, Kasmire single-center studies with varying temperature definitions
- WHO hypothermia definition and neonatal literature (Mullany et al.)
- AAP febrile infant guidelines (age stratification framework)

### Future Research Directions
- Multicenter validation of temperature stratification findings needed
- Development of validated clinical decision tools integrating temperature with other risk factors
- Prospective studies with standardized evaluation protocols
- Investigation of mechanisms underlying differential IBI risk by temperature
- Cost-effectiveness analysis of risk-stratified approaches

## Co-Authors
- Maya Singh Sharkey (MD Candidate Class of 2026, OHSU) - **Primary/First Author**
- Steve Mcgaughey (Senior Author - statistical/methodological support)
- David Sheridan, MD MCR (Associate Professor Emergency Medicine/Pediatrics, OHSU)
- Skyler Kieran (Data support, OCTRI)

## Project Summary
Retrospective observational study analyzing pediatric mental health emergency department presentations at OHSU from January 2018 to December 2023. Study examines trends across three cohorts: Pre-Pandemic (2018-2019), Pandemic (2020-2021), and Post-Pandemic (2022-2023). Total encounters: 1,908 (550 pre-pandemic, 564 pandemic, 794 post-pandemic). Uses interrupted time series analysis and proportion analysis to assess psychiatric visit burden relative to total ED volume.

## Current Status
**Manuscript preparation phase (January 2026).** Statistical analyses complete. Maya finalizing Results and Discussion sections. Team awaiting final manuscript draft before end-of-January 2026 submission to maintain momentum before Maya's May 2026 graduation.

## Key Decisions
- **January 2026**: Decided NOT to include restraint data due to inconsistent order set usage patterns (especially <9 years cohort: not used in 2019, 2020, 2022)
- **January 2026**: Adopted interrupted time series (ITS) as primary analysis over simple Poisson regression for methodological rigor
- **January 2026**: Incorporated proportion analysis (psychiatric visits as % of total ED volume) as critical contextual finding
- **December 2025**: Agreed to target end-of-January submission with flexibility if needed

## Action Items
- [x] Complete interrupted time series analysis with AR1 autocorrelation (Steve, completed Jan 21)
- [x] Run chi-square tests for disposition and return visits (Maya, completed - no significance found)
- [x] Run ANOVA for Length of Stay (Maya, completed - significant p<0.001)
- [x] Add proportion analysis with p-values (Steve, completed Jan 21)
- [ ] Maya: Complete final manuscript draft incorporating all statistical results
- [ ] Team: Review and finalize manuscript
- [ ] Submit to target journal (late January 2026)

## Timeline
- **November 2025**: Maya completed initial data review and chart abstraction
- **December 9, 2025**: Maya presented initial findings to David Sheridan
- **December 11, 2025**: Team discussed statistical approach; Steve began interrupted time series analysis
- **December 11, 2025**: Skyler Kieran provided total PED volume data (2018-2023)
- **December 15, 2025**: David and Steve encouraged Maya to maintain momentum toward publication
- **January 5, 2026**: Steve checked in on progress; offered restraint data analysis
- **January 12, 2026**: Maya reported chi-square completion (no significance for disposition/returns)
- **January 20, 2026**: Maya ran ANOVA for Length of Stay (statistically significant decrease post-pandemic)
- **January 21, 2026**: Steve delivered comprehensive statistical outputs including proportion analysis with chi-square p-values and interrupted time series results
- **January 23, 2026**: Current status - awaiting Maya's final manuscript integration

## Key Findings

### Visit Trends
- **Raw counts**: 44% increase post-pandemic vs pre-pandemic (22.9 â 33.1 mean monthly visits; IRR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.30-1.61, p<0.001)
- **Proportion analysis** (psychiatric visits as % of total ED volume):
  - Pre-pandemic: 2.0% of total ED visits
  - Pandemic: 3.0% (peak crisis period - 50% relative increase)
  - Post-pandemic: 2.5% (persistent 25% elevation above baseline)
- **Interpretation**: True mental health crisis during acute pandemic (proportion doubled despite ED volume collapse), with persistent but moderating elevation post-pandemic

### Length of Stay
- Mean LOS overall: 37.70 hours (SD 44.02)
- Trend: 42 hrs (2018) â peak 45 hrs (2021) â 33 hrs (2023)
- **Statistically significant** decrease post-pandemic (ANOVA p<0.001)
- No significance between pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts (p=0.702)

### Disposition and Returns
- Chi-square analysis: **No statistical significance** for:
  - Post-ED disposition across cohorts
  - 72-hour return visits
  - 30-day return visits
- Disposition trend (descriptive): Admissions increased (12% â 17% â 20%), discharges remained stable (~63-65%)

### Methodological Approach
- **Primary analysis**: Interrupted time series with AR1 autocorrelation structure
- **Proportion testing**: Chi-square tests (gold standard for proportions) showing significant increases
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Poisson regression with ED volume offset confirming findings
- **Restraint data**: Excluded due to inconsistent usage patterns

## Notes

### Scientific Rigor Emphasis
Team maintaining careful language to avoid claiming causation from observational data. Findings show temporal association and correlation, not causation. Multiple alternative explanations exist (changes in referral patterns, healthcare-seeking behavior, outpatient capacity, etc.).

### Study Design Strengths
- Comprehensive 6-year period spanning pre/during/post pandemic
- All charts manually reviewed for verification (beyond electronic abstraction)
- Rigorous multi-method statistical approach (ITS, chi-square, Poisson with offset)
- Proportion analysis controls for pandemic-related changes in overall ED utilization
- Regional diversity to published literature (Oregon, quaternary care center)

### Limitations
- Single-center study (OHSU) - limited generalizability
- Quaternary referral center may have selection bias
- Cannot establish causation from observational design
- No individual-level acuity or outcome measures
- Repeat visits counted independently (anonymized data requirement)

### Team Dynamics
- Maya: Primary investigator, data collection, chart review, primary manuscript writing
- Steve: Senior author providing statistical expertise, R coding, methodological guidance
- David: Academic mentor ensuring timeline adherence and publication quality
- Collaborative, supportive mentorship model focused on Maya's scholarly project completion before graduation

## Project Summary

Pragmatic randomized controlled trial evaluating whether a physician callback program for ED-discharged patients reduces 7-day return visits. Conducted at OHSU Adult ED (March-May 2024) with 3,435 patients randomized 1:1. Primary ITT analysis showed non-significant reduction (6.5% vs 7.5%, aOR 0.91, p=0.503). Key finding: as-treated analysis showed **1.5% absolute risk reduction** in patients who actually received callbacks (5.9% vs 7.4%, NNT=67) with 53% callback success rate.

## Current Status
**As of January 25, 2026:** Manuscript draft complete with full results and discussion sections. Currently in **figures and tables revision phase** based on comprehensive review.

**Critical path to submission:**
1. ✅ Manuscript draft completed
2. ✅ Comprehensive figures/tables review conducted
3. ⏳ CONSORT diagram creation (CRITICAL - required for RCT)
4. ⏳ Primary outcomes visualization with confidence intervals
5. ⏳ Table consolidation (reduce from 7 to 3-4 tables)
6. ⏳ Final submission preparation

**Manuscript Status:** 
- Full draft written with Introduction, Methods, Results (ITT and as-treated analyses), Discussion
- All statistical analyses complete
- Major strength: **1.5% absolute risk reduction** in as-treated analysis (clinically meaningful despite ITT non-significance)
- Comprehensive baseline characteristics table (Table 1) - well-structured
- Results tables 2-7 need consolidation per Annals standards

**Publication Readiness Assessment:**
- Methodology: Solid (first randomized callback study)
- Results: Complete and compelling (especially as-treated findings)  
- Visualization: **CRITICAL GAPS** - lacks required CONSORT diagram and primary figures
- Tables: Need consolidation to meet Annals preference (max 4-5 total)
- Cannot submit to Annals without CONSORT diagram
## Key Decisions
- **[Jul 2025]**: Reorganized results section with ITT vs as-treated subheadings per Steve's recommendation
- **[Jul 2025]**: Emphasized 1.5% absolute risk reduction as clinically relevant finding
- **[Jan 2026]**: Completed comprehensive figures/tables review
  - Decision: CONSORT diagram is non-negotiable for submission
  - Decision: Reduce tables from 7 to 3-4 (max allowed by Annals typically 4-5)
  - Decision: Emphasize visual presentation of key findings over text
  - Decision: Follow Schriger & Cooper (2001) graphical excellence principles
  - Strategy: Lead with clinical significance (1.5% ARR, 53% callback success) in figures
- **[SAEM 2025]**: Morgan Black delivered presentation with key findings
## Action Items
### Critical (Must Have - Cannot Publish Without)
- [ ] **CREATE CONSORT FLOW DIAGRAM** (required by Annals for RCTs)
  - Show: Total ED visits (6,934) → Eligible (3,435) → Randomized → Analyzed
  - Account for exclusions at each step (21 not called, 4 excluded post-randomization)
  - Standard CONSORT format with intervention/control parallel arms

### High Priority (Should Have for Impact)
- [ ] **Design primary outcomes bar chart**
  - Side-by-side bars with confidence interval error bars
  - Show 7-day return rates for intervention vs control
  - Clean design following Schriger & Cooper principles (remove chartjunk)
  
- [ ] **Consolidate results tables** (currently have 7, need 3-4 maximum)
  - Keep Table 1 (Baseline Characteristics) - already well-structured
  - Combine Tables 2-3 into single comprehensive results table
  - Streamline Tables 5-7 into single as-treated analysis table
  - Move detailed regression models to supplementary material

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] **Create as-treated analysis visualization**
  - Bar chart showing outcomes by actual callback receipt
  - Demonstrates the 1.5% absolute risk reduction
  - 53% callback success rate should be prominent
  
- [ ] **Consider callback success rates figure**
  - Visualize the 922 contacted vs 808 not contacted split
  - Shows operational challenges and real-world applicability

### Final Review
- [ ] Follow Annals visual style guidelines (Schriger & Cooper 2001)
- [ ] Ensure all figures use consistent formatting
- [ ] Emphasize clinical significance over statistical significance
- [ ] Verify all figures are self-explanatory with clear legends

## Notes

### Key Findings

**ITT Analysis:**
- Intervention: 6.5% (113/1,730) 7-day return rate
- Control: 7.5% (128/1,705) 7-day return rate
- Unadjusted OR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.66-1.12)
- Adjusted OR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.70-1.19, p=0.503)

**As-Treated Analysis (Key Clinical Finding):**
- 922/1,730 (53%) successfully contacted
- Contacted patients: 5.9% return rate (54/922)
- Non-contacted: 7.4% return rate (187/2,513)
- **1.5% absolute risk reduction**
- **NNT = 67**
- Adjusted OR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.61-1.15, p=0.288)

**Strongest Predictors of ED Return:**
- High ED utilization (≥4 visits/12mo): aOR 2.88 (p<0.001)
- Mental health diagnosis: aOR 1.44 (p=0.015)
- Homelessness: aOR 1.78 (p=0.043)
- African American/Black race: aOR 1.59 (p=0.043) - potential disparity

### Methodological Strengths

- First randomized study evaluating ED callback program on return visits
- Pragmatic design with real-world applicability
- Large sample size (n=3,435)
- Both ITT and as-treated analyses
- Inclusive of non-English speakers (except sign language)

### Limitations

- Single-center (OHSU)
- 47% callback failure rate limits ITT effect detection
- Cannot capture returns to other health systems
- Study personnel not blinded

### Figures & Tables Review (January 2026)

**Current State:**
- **Tables**: 7 tables present (Table 1 + Tables 2-7 for results)
- **Figures**: ZERO figures present (critical gap)
- **Status**: Methodologically sound but presentation-limited

**Table Assessment:**
- ✅ Table 1 (Baseline Characteristics): Well-organized, good use of SMD, comprehensive
- ⚠️ Tables 2-3: Redundant information, should be combined
- ⚠️ Tables 5-7: Need streamlining or move to supplementary material

**Critical Missing Figures:**
1. **CONSORT Flow Diagram** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Required for RCT publication in Annals
   - Must show: Total screened → Eligible → Randomized → Analyzed
   - Must account for all exclusions
   
2. **Primary Outcomes Visualization** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Bar chart with confidence intervals
   - Show intervention vs control 7-day return rates
   - Visual impact essential for manuscript

3. **As-Treated Analysis Results** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Outcomes by actual callback receipt
   - Demonstrates dose-response relationship
   - Highlights the 1.5% ARR finding

**Recommended Figure Strategy:**
- Figure 1: CONSORT flow diagram (MANDATORY)
- Figure 2: Primary outcomes by study arm (side-by-side bars with CI)
- Figure 3: As-treated analysis (bar chart showing 53% success rate, outcomes)

**Recommended Table Strategy:**
- Table 1: Baseline characteristics (keep current)
- Table 2: Primary and secondary outcomes combined (merge Tables 2-3)
- Table 3: As-treated analysis results streamlined (consolidate Tables 5-7)
- Supplementary Table: Detailed regression models (move complex analyses)

**Visual Design Principles to Follow:**
- Simplify graphics - remove chartjunk, use clean design
- Maximize data density - show individual data points when possible
- Use appropriate scales - don't truncate y-axes inappropriately
- Clear legends - make figures self-explanatory
- Consistent formatting - same font, style throughout

## Methodological Strengths
### Methodological Strengths

- First randomized study evaluating ED callback program on return visits
- Pragmatic design with real-world applicability
- Large sample size (n=3,435)
- Both ITT and as-treated analyses
- Inclusive of non-English speakers (except sign language)
- 1:1 randomization with balanced baseline characteristics (SMD ≤0.12 except race)

### Study Details

**Inclusion Criteria:**

- Discharged from ED

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Left without being seen (LWBS)
- Left against medical advice (AMA)
- Admitted to hospital

- Sign language requirement (video translation services limitation)

**Post-Randomization Exclusions:**
- 21 patients in intervention group not called (already back in ED/hospital at callback time)
  - Still included in ITT analysis (couldn't retrospectively identify matching controls)
- 4 patients excluded after randomization:
  - 3 controls: couldn't provide video translation for sign language
  - 2 intervention: 1 used false identification, 1 withdrew due to privacy concerns

**Intervention Details:**
- Telephone calls made within 2 days of ED discharge

## Limitations
### Limitations

- Single-center study (OHSU) - limits generalizability
- 47% callback failure rate limits ITT effect detection
  - Cannot capture true intervention effect when nearly half don't receive it
  - As-treated analysis addresses this but introduces selection bias potential
- Cannot capture returns to other health systems (only OHSU returns tracked)
- Study personnel not blinded to allocation
  - Nature of intervention made blinding impossible
  - Outcome assessment (ED return) objective and not subject to bias
- Pragmatic design trade-offs:
  - Real-world applicability vs. controlled conditions
  - Included patients already back in ED/hospital in ITT analysis
- Two-day callback window may miss early returns
- Cannot assess long-term effects beyond 7 days
- No cost-effectiveness analysis performed

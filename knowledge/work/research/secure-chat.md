## Project Summary

Pre-post implementation study evaluating ED physician satisfaction with Epic Secure Chat following October 2024 implementation at academic ED (47 adult attendings, 15 pediatric attendings, 33 residents; 42 beds; 60,000 annual visits). Study compares secure messaging against traditional communication modalities (face-to-face, phone, paging) across five domains using 4-point Likert scales (ease of use, efficiency, timeliness, clarity, overall satisfaction). Survey response rates: 33% pre-implementation (n=31/95), 34% post-implementation (n=32/95). Includes objective workflow data showing reduction in repeat consult orders from 22% to 18% across 26,376 ED encounters (χ²(1, N = 26,376) = 50.51, p < .001). Manuscript formatted as WestJEM Brief Research Report (1,480 words, 1 table, 1 figure).

## Current Status
**Major revision requested by WestJEM (February 2026).** Peer review completed and editor decision is major revision — not rejection. Steve (senior author) will handle revisions and resubmission since primary author has moved to private practice. Target: revise and resubmit within one week.

## Key Decisions

- **June-July 2025**: Initially drafted as ~2,500-word manuscript with 6 tables - exceeded WestJEM Brief Research Report limits
- **August 2025**: Decision to target WestJEM Brief Research Report format (1,500 words max, 2 tables/figures max) rather than full Original Research article
- **October 2025**: Editorial review identified word count violations and incomplete statistical reporting (missing U statistics in multiple comparisons)
- **October 2025**: Chose WestJEM over Applied Clinical Informatics - better fit for emergency medicine audience; Brief Research Report format more appropriate than ACI's Brief Scientific Communication
- **November 11, 2025**: Completed major revision - reduced to 1,480 words through aggressive content reduction while retaining all essential statistical findings; added complete U statistics throughout
- **November 2025**: Corrected causation language throughout - changed from causal claims to association language for pre-post study design
- **November 2025**: Eliminated all AI-removal words
- **November 2025**: Clarified IRB language
- **February 2026**: Major revision decision received. Steve taking lead on revisions since primary author moved to private practice.

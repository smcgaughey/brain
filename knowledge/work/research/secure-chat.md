## Project Summary

Pre-post implementation study evaluating ED physician satisfaction with Epic Secure Chat following October 2024 implementation at academic ED (47 adult attendings, 15 pediatric attendings, 33 residents; 42 beds; 60,000 annual visits). Study compares secure messaging against traditional communication modalities (face-to-face, phone, paging) across five domains using 4-point Likert scales (ease of use, efficiency, timeliness, clarity, overall satisfaction). Survey response rates: 33% pre-implementation (n=31/95), 34% post-implementation (n=32/95). Includes objective workflow data showing reduction in repeat consult orders from 22% to 18% across 26,376 ED encounters (ÏÂ²(1, N = 26,376) = 50.51, p < .001). Manuscript formatted as WestJEM Brief Research Report (1,480 words, 1 table, 1 figure).

## Current Status
**Revised manuscript resubmitted to WestJEM on November 11, 2025 (MS# 53220).** Initial submission occurred October 21, 2025. Editorial decision received November 4, 2025 requesting minor revisions before full peer review. Steven McGaughey took over as corresponding author and made significant revisions including addition of data not included in initial submission. Revised manuscript currently under peer review with 1 completed review. Manuscript formatted as Brief Research Report (1,480 words, 2 tables/figures). Statistical reporting includes complete Mann-Whitney U test results (medians, IQR, U statistics, p-values) for all satisfaction comparisons and chi-square analysis for repeat consult order reduction (22% to 18%, ÏÂ²(1, N = 26,376) = 50.51, p < .001).
## Key Decisions

- **June-July 2025**: Initially drafted as ~2,500-word manuscript with 6 tables - exceeded WestJEM Brief Research Report limits
- **August 2025**: Decision to target WestJEM Brief Research Report format (1,500 words max, 2 tables/figures max) rather than full Original Research article
- **October 2025**: Editorial review identified word count violations and incomplete statistical reporting (missing U statistics in multiple comparisons)
- **October 2025**: Chose WestJEM over Applied Clinical Informatics - better fit for emergency medicine audience; Brief Research Report format more appropriate than ACI's Brief Scientific Communication
- **November 11, 2025**: Completed major revision - reduced to 1,480 words through aggressive content reduction while retaining all essential statistical findings; added complete U statistics throughout (Baratta et al. 2023, Luu et al. 2024, Gulacti et al. 2017 used as models)
- **November 2025**: Corrected causation language throughout - changed from causal claims ("reduced repeat consults") to association language ("associated with reduction in repeat consults") to accurately reflect pre-post study design limitations
- **November 2025**: Eliminated all AI-removal words - replaced "demonstrated" â "showed," "viable" â "workable," "adjunct" â "addition," "minimizing" â "reducing," "warranting" â "requiring," "advantages" â "benefits," "valuable" â "useful"
- **November 2025**: Clarified IRB language - changed from "granted exemption" to "determined this project to be quality improvement, not human subjects research, thus not requiring IRB oversight" (accurate reflection of IRB Request for Determination process)
- **November 2025**: Removed Type I error adjustment justification - decided unadjusted alpha (Î± = .05) appropriate for exploratory QI study with transparency about multiple comparisons rather than defensive Bonferroni correction
- **October 21, 2025**: Initial manuscript submitted to WestJEM (MS# 53220) with Michaela Go as corresponding author
- **November 4, 2025**: Editorial decision received requesting minor revisions before full peer review
- **November 11, 2025**: Steven McGaughey took over as corresponding author, made significant revisions including addition of previously excluded data, and resubmitted revised manuscript

## Notes

### Study Design & Setting
- **Design**: Pre-post implementation survey study with objective workflow analysis
- **Setting**: Large academic ED with 42 licensed beds, ~60,000 annual visits
- **Sample**: 95 ED physicians (47 adult attendings, 15 pediatric attendings, 33 EM residents)
- **Study team**: Four emergency physicians (2 clinical informaticists, 2 administrative leaders)
- **Implementation date**: October 2024 (Epic Secure Chat system-wide rollout)

### Communication Workflows (Pre-Implementation)
- **ED physicians**: Carried hospital phones for calls from transfer centers, prehospital providers, specialty consultants, nursing staff
- **Physician-nurse communication**: Primarily face-to-face
- **Specialty consultations**: Consult orders placed in EHR â command center pages consultant â return call connected to ED physician's direct line â follow-up required new consult order
- **Nurses**: Used Vocera devices for nurse-to-nurse communication

### Secure Chat Tool Features
- **Platform**: Epic Secure Chat integrated with EHR
- **Access**: Desktop and mobile applications
- **Functionality**: Search recipients or select from patient's care team (ED resident, attending, assigned nurse); attach patient charts; read receipt confirmation
- **Implementation approach**: Complementary tool, not replacement for existing methods
- **Escalation protocol**: If no response within appropriate timeframe, escalate to paging/phone
- **Designated use**: Non-emergent messages (informational updates, routine clarifications)
- **Explicit non-use**: Urgent communications (abnormal vital signs, critical lab values)
- **Education**: Pre-implementation presentations at division/departmental meetings; internal resource page with tip sheets and escalation guidance

### Measures & Data Collection
**Survey domains** (4-point Likert scales):
- Satisfaction: ease of use, efficiency, timeliness, clarity, overall satisfaction (1=very dissatisfied, 2=somewhat dissatisfied, 3=somewhat satisfied, 4=very satisfied)
- Interruption frequency: 1=never, 2=rarely, 3=sometimes, 4=always
- Interruption disruptiveness: 1=not disruptive, 2=somewhat disruptive, 3=very disruptive, 4=extremely disruptive

**Repeat consult order analysis**:
- Pre-period: July 1-September 30, 2024 (3 months)
- Post-period: November 1, 2024-February 28, 2025 (4 months)
- Excluded: October 2024 (adoption ramp-up)
- Definition: Consultation for same specialty within same ED encounter
- Total encounters analyzed: 26,376

**Demographics**: Sex and gender not collected (no anticipated sex/gender-based differences)

### Statistical Methods
- **Tests**: Mann-Whitney U for ordinal Likert scale satisfaction comparisons (non-parametric); Chi-squared test of independence for categorical repeat consult data
- **Alpha level**: Unadjusted (Î± = .05); did not adjust for multiple comparisons - appropriate for exploratory QI study with transparency about comparisons
- **Reporting standards**: All tests include medians, IQR, U statistics (or ÏÂ²), and p-values per medical journal standards (Baratta et al. 2023, Luu et al. 2024 as models)
- **Analysis tools**: Python 3.12.7 (NumPy 1.26.4, Pandas 2.2.2, SciPy 1.13.1, Plotly 5.24.1)
- **Design**: Anonymous surveys with unpaired responses between timepoints

### Key Findings

**Communication with ED nursing**:
1. Secure chat vs. face-to-face: Secure chat higher ease of use (median 4 [IQR 3-4] vs 3 [IQR 2-4], U = 392.0, p = .04); face-to-face higher clarity (median 4 [IQR 3-4] vs 3 [IQR 3-4], U = 729.5, p = .008); no differences in efficiency, timeliness, overall satisfaction
2. Secure chat vs. phone: Secure chat higher ease of use (median 4 [IQR 3-4] vs 2 [IQR 2-3], U = 231.5, p < .001), efficiency (median 3 [IQR 3-4] vs 2.5 [IQR 2-3], U = 308.0, p = .002), overall satisfaction (median 3 [IQR 3-4] vs 2 [IQR 2-3], U = 293.0, p < .001); no differences in clarity or timeliness
3. Overall nursing communication satisfaction: Significant shift toward higher satisfaction post-implementation (median 3 [IQR 3-4] vs 3 [IQR 2-3], U = 384.0, p = .03)

**Communication with specialty consultants**:
1. Secure chat vs. consult order workflow: Secure chat superior across ALL domains
   - Ease of use: U = 235.5, p < .001
   - Efficiency: U = 168.5, p < .001
   - Clarity: U = 349.5, p = .033
   - Overall satisfaction: U = 224.0, p < .001

**Workflow impact**:
1. Repeat consult orders: 22% pre-implementation â 18% post-implementation (ÏÂ²(1, N = 26,376) = 50.51, p < .001) - 4 percentage point reduction associated with implementation

**Interruption burden**:
1. Phone interruptions rated most disruptive (median = 3 "very disruptive")
2. Face-to-face and secure chat less disruptive (median = 2 "somewhat disruptive")
3. Secure chat interruptions less disruptive than phone (U = 850.5, p < .001)

### Methodological Strengths
- Head-to-head comparisons across all communication modalities in same population
- Multi-domain satisfaction assessment (5 domains)
- Combination of subjective (satisfaction) and objective (repeat consult orders) measures
- ED-specific focus (fills literature gap - only 2 prior ED-specific studies: Luu et al. 2022, Gulacti et al. 2017)
- Pre-post design allows within-subject comparison of communication satisfaction before and after tool availability
- Adequate sample size for non-parametric statistical testing
- Anonymous surveys reduce social desirability bias

### Limitations Acknowledged
- Single-site academic ED (limits generalizability)
- Pre-post design cannot establish causation or control for confounding factors (seasonal variations, operational changes)
- Three-month follow-up may not represent steady-state usage patterns
- Physician-only perspective (no nursing, consultant, or patient perspectives)
- 66-67% non-response rate (potential for non-response bias)
- No adjustment for multiple comparisons (Type I error inflation risk)
- Excluded October adoption period may not capture full implementation challenges

### Positioning Against Prior Work

**Prior ED secure messaging studies**:
- **Luu et al. (2022)**: Similar ED secure chat study; focused on workflow interruptions and burnout; did not include head-to-head comparisons across modalities or specialist consultation analysis
- **Gulacti et al. (2017)**: RCT comparing WhatsApp vs. telephone for ED consultations; focused on length of stay rather than user satisfaction; used non-EHR-integrated messaging platform

**Our unique contribution**: First study to systematically compare physician satisfaction across ALL ED communication modalities (face-to-face, phone, paging, secure messaging) with EHR-integrated platform; includes both satisfaction metrics AND objective workflow data (repeat consults); fills critical gap in ED-specific secure messaging literature

**Inpatient secure messaging literature** (cited as context):
- Baratta et al. (2023), Knees et al. (2025), Przybylo et al. (2023), Edwards et al. (2021), Byrd et al. (2023) - demonstrates high satisfaction, reduced communication failures, decreased LOS in inpatient settings
- Our study extends these findings to unique ED environment with different communication patterns and workflow constraints

### Word Count Strategy (November 2025 Revision)

**Achieved 1,480 words (from 2,500) by**:
- Removed redundant EHR chat feature descriptions in Introduction (Epic Secure Chat already described adequately in Methods)
- Condensed verbose hypothesis statement to concise aims statement
- Streamlined communication workflow descriptions (removed excessive detail about ED geography, nurse pod locations)
- Eliminated obvious interpretations of results embedded in Results section (e.g., "higher ratings likely reflect ease of not needing to physically locate individuals")
- Removed entire Medicolegal Implications subsection from Discussion (not essential for brief report format; beyond scope)
- Deleted defensive survey response rate justification paragraph in Limitations (response rates already reported transparently in Results; over-explanation unnecessary)
- Consolidated verbose limitation explanations
- **Retained ALL essential statistical findings with complete reporting** (no sacrifice of scientific rigor for word count)

### Cover Letter Key Points (Draft Prepared October 2025)

**Opening**: "We submit for consideration 'Can EHR Secure Chat Improve Emergency Department Communication?' as a Brief Research Report. This work addresses an important gap in understanding how EHR-integrated secure messaging affects emergency department physician communication and workflow."

**Literature gap**: Two prior ED studies (Luu et al. 2022 - workflow interruptions; Gulacti et al. 2017 - WhatsApp length of stay) but neither evaluated head-to-head satisfaction comparisons or EHR-integrated platform impact on consultant workflows

**Key findings**: Secure chat superior to existing consult workflow across all domains (all p<.001); associated with 4 percentage point reduction in repeat consult orders (22% â 18%, p<.001); face-to-face maintains clarity advantage (important for appropriate use guidance)

**Journal alignment**: Directly aligns with WestJEM focus on "health systems and delivery of emergency care" and technology solutions for ED operations and workflow efficiency

**Status declarations**: No prior presentation, no conflicts of interest, no funding, QI determination by IRB, AI use disclosed per policy

### Special Considerations

**Statistical reporting philosophy**: Complete transparency preferred over selective reporting - all comparisons reported with full statistics (median, IQR, U, p) even when non-significant; allows readers to evaluate effect sizes and clinical significance independently

**Causation language precision**: Consistently use "associated with" for repeat consult reduction (not "reduced" or "decreased") - acknowledges pre-post design cannot establish causation without controlled trial; protects against overclaiming while still reporting important finding

**Multiple comparisons approach**: Unadjusted alpha appropriate for exploratory QI study - Bonferroni correction would be overly conservative and increase Type II error risk; transparency about multiple comparisons allows readers to interpret findings appropriately (aligned with American Statistical Association guidance)

**AI transparency**: Full disclosure of ChatGPT use for statistical reference guidance (not data analysis) - demonstrates commitment to research integrity and compliance with emerging journal AI policies

**Word count discipline**: Aggressive content reduction achieved while retaining scientific rigor - demonstrates feasibility of Brief Research Report format for meaningful QI studies with complex statistical analyses

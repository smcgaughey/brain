# Nuts & Bolts AI Literacy Paper
**Project Type:** Academic Pediatrics invited submission  
**Target Section:** Nuts & Bolts (visual, practical education guide)  
**Status:** Draft under review with co-authors

## Author Team
- **Steve McGaughey** (1st author) - OHSU Emergency Medicine, Clinical Informatics
- **Jordan Wackett** (middle author) - OHSU Emergency Medicine, Director of Health & Design, infographic design
- **Jessica Bailey** (senior author) - OHSU Pediatrics, APPD member confirmed

## Core Concept Evolution
**Original focus:** Teaching faculty how to use AI tools  
**Revised focus (per editorial feedback):** Teaching strategies for bedside AI education with learners

### The "Walled Garden" Approach
- Uses source-grounded AI tools (NotebookLM as primary example)
- **IMPORTANT:** Need to mention additional tools (e.g., Claude with Projects, ChatGPT with file uploads) to avoid product endorsement
- Faculty upload curated sources → AI can only reference those materials
- Eliminates hallucination concerns ("open-book test" analogy)
- Builds on faculty's existing trust in curated evidence (UpToDate parallel)

### Limitations & Safety Considerations (To Add)
- **What could go wrong:** Outdated sources, over-reliance on AI outputs without verification, failure to validate learner understanding
- **Common mistakes:** Skipping source validation step, not checking citations, using AI to replace rather than enhance clinical reasoning
- **Boundaries:** When NOT to use AI (real-time critical decisions, replacing direct patient interaction, shortcuts that bypass learning)
- **Quality control:** How faculty ensure teaching quality isn't degraded (spot-checking, asking learners to explain reasoning, periodic assessment)
## Editorial Guidance (Drs. Mahan & Turner)
- **Key requirement:** Focus on teaching strategies, not just AI best practices
- **Ideal scope:** 1-2 crisp learning objectives maximum
- **Alternative:** Consider Part 1 & Part 2 series if content too extensive
- **Format:** Infographic-style, immediately actionable for busy faculty
- **Target:** Bedside teaching scenario with 2-3 specific strategies

### Tone & Voice (Reinforced by Jess Feedback)
- **Essential:** Maintain practical, witty, honest tone throughout
- **Audience connection:** Educators feeling wary/uncertain about AI expertise
- **Acknowledge reality:** Many faculty feel they have nothing to teach trainees about AI
- **Recognition:** Trainees may know more than teachers in this domain
- **Balance:** Expert clinical educator identity with learner identity in AI space

### Scope & Applicability (Added per Jess)
- **Learner Range:** Must explicitly state applies to medical students → residents → fellows
- **Setting Range:** Call out diverse pediatric environments:
  - Pediatric emergency departments
  - Inpatient wards/hospital medicine
  - Outpatient general pediatrics clinics
  - Subspecialty clinics and consultative settings
## Teaching Framework: RACE for Prompting
- **R**ole - Define AI's role
- **A**ction - Specify desired task  
- **C**ontext - Provide relevant background (CRITICAL safety element)
- **E**xpectation - Describe output format/quality

## The "Teaching Cascade" Innovation
**One faculty action produces three outcomes:**
1. Personal efficiency gains
2. Hidden curriculum modeling of responsible AI use
3. Explicit AI literacy skill development in learners

## Clinical Vignettes Developed
- Pediatric DKA management
- Kawasaki disease evaluation
- Using institutional protocols as uploaded sources

## Jessica Bailey's Feedback (January 29, 2026)
### Tone & Approach
- **Loves overall tone:** Practical, witty, honest - "I feel smarter already, haha"
- **Key strength:** Will resonate with educators (especially our generation+) feeling wary about AI
- Acknowledges reality: Many faculty feel they have nothing to teach trainees in this area
- Recognizes uncomfortable truth: Trainees may know more than teachers about AI
- Balances expert clinical educator identity with learner identity in AI space
- **Critical:** Maintain this approachable, honest voice throughout final piece

### Scope Clarifications Needed
1. **Learner range:** Explicitly state applies to medical students → residents → fellows
2. **Setting range:** Call out diverse pediatric environments:
   - Pediatric emergency departments
   - Inpatient wards/hospital medicine
   - Outpatient general pediatrics clinics
   - Subspecialty clinics and consultative settings

### Product Neutrality
- **Critical:** Add at least one other "walled garden" tool besides NotebookLM
- Examples to consider: Claude with Projects, ChatGPT with file uploads
- Avoid appearing as single-product endorsement
- Could add in parenthetical examples section or tools overview

### Safety/Limitations Section
- **Question raised:** "Do we need to add 'how this could get screwed up?'"
- **Possible formats:** 
  - Limitations section
  - 2-3 FAQs box
  - "Don'ts" callout list
- **Jess wondering:** Will editors require this?
- **Content suggestions:**
  - What could go wrong: Outdated sources, over-reliance without verification, failure to validate learner understanding
  - Common mistakes: Skipping source validation, not checking citations, replacing vs. enhancing clinical reasoning
  - Boundaries: When NOT to use (real-time critical decisions, replacing patient interaction, bypassing learning)
  - Quality control: How to ensure teaching quality (spot-checking, asking learners to explain, periodic assessment)

### Progressive Independence Timeline Revision
- **Change from:** Numbered "weeks" 
- **Change to:** Numbered "clinical interactions"
- **Rationale:** Adds critical flexibility for different teaching environments
- **Benefit:** Programs have varying educator-trainee continuity levels
- **Impact:** Timeline can shorten or lengthen based on context
- Makes intervention more universally applicable across settings

### APPD Membership Status
- ✅ **CONFIRMED:** Active APPD membership via OHSU Pediatrics dual appointment
- Reached out to Michael Grubbs in Dept of Pediatrics for updated login verification

### Outstanding Questions from Jess
- "Can you clarify what you mean by 'Pediatric residency authenticity check' in the to-do list?"
### Tone & Approach
- **Loves overall tone:** Practical, witty, honest
- Should connect with educators feeling wary about AI expertise gap
- Acknowledges educators feeling less expert than trainees in this domain
- Appeals to "our generation or above" feeling uncertain

### Scope Clarifications Needed
1. **Learner range:** Explicitly state applies to medical students → residents → fellows
2. **Setting range:** State applies broadly (Peds ED, inpatient wards, outpatient clinic, etc.)

### Product Neutrality
- **Critical:** Add at least one other "walled garden" tool besides NotebookLM
- Avoid appearing as product endorsement
- Could add in parenthetical examples section

### Safety/Limitations Section
- **Question raised:** Should we add "how this could get screwed up"?
- Possible formats: Limitations section, 2-3 FAQs, or "Don'ts" list
- Jess wondering if editors will require this

### Progressive Independence Timeline Revision
- **Change from:** Numbered "weeks" 
- **Change to:** Numbered "clinical interactions"
- **Rationale:** Adds flexibility for different teaching environments
- Different programs have varying educator-trainee continuity
- Makes intervention more universally applicable

### Outstanding Questions
- What does "Pediatric residency authenticity check" mean in to-do list?

## Key Analogies Developed
- **Open-book test:** AI can only use the textbook you provide
- **UpToDate parallel:** Faculty already trust curated evidence sources
- **Walled garden:** Constrains AI to faculty-uploaded sources only

## Format Specifications
- **Length:** ~1,500-2,000 words
- **Visual emphasis:** Infographics that replace rather than illustrate text
- **Style:** Professional medical education aesthetic
- **References:** Minimal in body, comprehensive in bibliography

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Immediately useful to faculty with no AI background
- [ ] 1-2 crisp, clear learning objectives
- [ ] Includes RACE framework with clinical examples
- [ ] Visually engaging tables/figures
- [ ] Concise (~1,500-2,000 words)
- [ ] Not overwhelming to busy clinicians
- [ ] Ready for Academic Pediatrics submission

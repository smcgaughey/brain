# JAMA Pediatrics - ED Readiness and Mortality Study

**Status:** Submitting February 2026
**Position:** Middle author (co-author)
**Theme:** Pediatric Emergency Outcomes
**Lead:** Craig Newgard, MD MPH (PI)

---

## Project Summary

Large cohort study examining the impact of emergency department (ED) pediatric readiness and pediatric inpatient services on child mortality across 11 states over a decade (2012-2021). Study demonstrates significant associations between ED readiness levels, inpatient service availability, and preventable pediatric deaths.

**Sample:** 2,416,030 children treated in 759 EDs across 11 states (2012-2021)

---

## Key Findings

### ED Pediatric Readiness Impact

**High-Readiness EDs (Lives Saved):**
- EDs that maintained high readiness OR improved over time
- **Associated with 7,032 lives saved**

**Low-Readiness EDs (Preventable Deaths):**
- EDs with persistent low readiness OR those that declined
- **Associated with 4,313 preventable deaths**

### Inpatient Services Impact

**Hospitals with Inpatient Services:**
- Hospitals that maintained OR gained inpatient pediatric services
- **Associated with 24,970 lives saved**

**Hospitals without Inpatient Services:**
- Lack of inpatient services implied negative outcomes
- Preventable deaths not explicitly quantified but implied by context

### Study Design Features
- Accounted for ED case mix
- Accounted for hospital type
- Longitudinal analysis (2012-2021)
- 11-state cohort

## Study Significance

### Clinical Impact
- Quantifies lives saved by high ED readiness: **7,032 lives**
- Quantifies preventable deaths from low readiness: **4,313 deaths**
- Demonstrates massive impact of inpatient services: **24,970 lives saved**
- Provides evidence-based rationale for pediatric readiness investments

### Study Strengths
- Large sample size (2.4+ million children)
- Longitudinal design (10-year period)
- Multi-state cohort (11 states)
- Large number of EDs (759)
- Accounts for case mix and hospital type
- Uses national pediatric readiness assessment data

### Policy Implications
- Demonstrates concrete mortality benefits of ED pediatric readiness
- Shows importance of maintaining/gaining inpatient pediatric services
- Provides data to support resource allocation for pediatric emergency care
- Highlights risks of declining readiness or losing inpatient services

## Project Summary

An IRB-approved three-phase needs assessment study to address research silos in the OHSU Emergency Medicine department. Using constructivist grounded theory methodology with UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) framework integration to develop a collaborative research tool that better connects projects, personnel, and resources across the department. Primary aim is improving perceived research collaboration opportunities as reported by at least 50% of faculty and learners.

## Current Status
**Phase 1 - Needs Assessment (Months 0-3):** Currently in active data collection phase. Completed 2 focus groups as of February 2026:
1. Research Leadership focus group (January 12, 2026 - 9 participants) with comprehensive thematic analysis completed
2. Junior Faculty focus group (completed January 2026)

**Next Scheduled:** Leadership/Senior Faculty focus group on Thursday, February 5, 2026

**Recruitment Status:**
- ✅ Research Leadership: Completed (1/12/26) - Brandon Maughan, Matt Hansen, Bory Kea, David Sheridan, Joshua Lupton, Jenny Cook, Denise, Nathan Bahr, Abby Dotson
- ✅ Junior Faculty: Completed (January 2026)
- 🔄 ED Leadership/Senior Faculty: In recruitment - Updated target list includes Mary, Beech, Mo, Jon Jui, Lainie, Rob Hendrickson, Dave Jones, Lauren Sigman/Bri Miller, and APDs (for student/residency leadership perspective per Jaime's suggestion)
- 🔄 Trainees/Residents: Pending follow-up for focus group scheduling

**Mentor Participation:** Jaime Jordan will attend one additional focus group as observer only (not participant, to maintain study integrity per her guidance on 1/30/26)

## Key Decisions
- **August 2025**: Selected constructivist grounded theory methodology with UTAUT integration based on mentor (Jamie) recommendation for hybrid thematic approach that balances emergent discovery with framework-guided analysis
- **August 2025**: Decided to use semi-structured interview protocol combining CGT core questions (opening, transition, key questions) with UTAUT integration questions (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions)
- **December 2025**: Decided on targeted recruitment using purposeful sampling rather than mass email outreach to prevent group fragmentation and ensure adequate participation
- **December 2025**: Selected When2Meet for availability collection to maximize scheduling flexibility and identify optimal times with maximum participant overlap
- **December 2025**: Set focus group parameters based on qualitative research best practices:
  - Group size: 5-7 participants (allows adequate discussion while maintaining manageability)
  - No participant incentives (per IRB constraints)
  - Virtual-only format (increases accessibility, reduces scheduling barriers)
  - Duration: 60-75 minutes (balances comprehensive discussion with participant time constraints)
- **January 2026**: Adopted multi-layered analytical strategy for Focus Group #1:
  - Initial inductive coding (pure CGT - let themes emerge organically)
  - Deductive mapping to UTAUT framework constructs  
  - Cross-cutting analysis across question types
  - Stakeholder-specific pattern identification
  - Validation checking themes against raw data
- **January 2026**: Created comprehensive analytical audit trail for methodological transparency and trustworthiness, documenting: initial reading impressions, open coding with analytical memos, focused coding categories, axial coding relationships, theoretical integration decisions, UTAUT mapping process, and quality assessment using Lincoln & Guba criteria (credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability)
- **January 30, 2026**: Expanded leadership focus group target list based on Jaime's feedback to include Dave Jones, Lauren Sigman/Bri Miller, and APDs for student/residency leadership perspective; Jaime will observe (not participate) in one additional focus group

- Group 3: Senior/ED Leadership (>5 years as faculty) - Thursday 2/5/26
- Group 4: Trainees (residents and medical students) - Pending
- Pre/Post Surveys: All ~250 department members

### Research Leadership Focus Group - Detailed Thematic Findings

**Focus Group Details:**
- Date: January 12, 2026
- Duration: ~60 minutes  
- Participants: 9 research leaders (Brandon Maughan, Matt Hansen, Bory Kea, David Sheridan, Joshua Lupton, Jenny Cook, Denise, Nathan Bahr, Abby Dotson)
- Format: Virtual, audio recorded and transcribed

**Eight Major Themes Identified (Organized into Structural and Human/Relational Factors):**

**STRUCTURAL BARRIERS:**

**Theme 1: The Craig Newgard Transition** - Loss of central coordinating figure revealed coordination infrastructure gaps. Craig served multiple critical functions: knowledge broker connecting people with opportunities, matchmaker pairing complementary skills, gatekeeper managing participation appropriately, and resource coordinator. His departure (with significant P&T committee influence) created natural inflection point for systematic change as department adapts to new leadership under Matt Hansen.

**Theme 2: Generator vs. Finder Identity** - Research leaders see themselves as opportunity "generators" rather than "seekers," creating asymmetric information flow. Leaders generate opportunities (grants, projects, collaborations) but lack effective mechanisms for broadcasting these to potential collaborators. This identity mismatch means those who have opportunities aren't actively seeking collaborators through existing channels.

**Theme 3: Visibility Crisis** - Even research leaders lack comprehensive knowledge of ongoing projects within the department. Jenny Cook (19 years institutional memory) noted this problem emerged with departmental growth over 10-15 years - organic networking that worked at small scale insufficient at current scale. Leaders don't know what research is happening, who is doing what, or where expertise resides even within their own department.

**Theme 4: Departmental Growth & Evolution** - Department transitioned from small focused team where informal connections worked to large diverse portfolio requiring systematic infrastructure. What functioned through hallway conversations and personal relationships at 30 people fails at 100+ people. Scale necessitates different coordination mechanisms.

**HUMAN/RELATIONAL FACTORS:**

**Theme 5: The Engagement Paradox** - **CRITICAL FINDING**: Successful collaboration requires initiative, yet potential collaborators don't know where to start or what to do. Evidence of paradox severity:
  - Zero residents enrolled in research residency track for 2 consecutive years
  - Zero residents attended research career session  
  - Residents explicitly stated "NO research" in career planning
  - Initiative and knowledge create catch-22: need initiative to engage but need knowledge to take initiative
  - "We can't go find them if they aren't coming" (Jenny Cook)

**Theme 6: Specificity Problem** - Research leaders need specific information from potential collaborators (interests, time commitment available, skills, experience level) to make good matches. However, junior faculty and trainees often lack clarity themselves about what they want, what they can offer, or how much time they can commit, making matching difficult.

**Theme 7: Expectation Management** - Mismatched expectations about research commitment and follow-through creates frustration. Leaders expect sustained engagement and follow-through when people join projects, but don't always receive it. Lack of clear expectation-setting upfront about time commitment, responsibilities, and deliverables contributes to problems.

**Theme 8: Communication & Dissemination Gap** - Current methods (email, departmental website, word of mouth) inadequate for effective opportunity broadcasting and discovery. Email gets lost or ignored, website static and not consulted regularly, word of mouth only reaches those already in networks. Need better mechanisms for push notifications and pull discovery.

**Cross-Cutting Insights:**
- Leadership transition creates natural inflection point with reduced resistance to change
- Multiple themes interconnect: visibility crisis + generator identity + communication gap = engagement paradox
- System-level solutions needed (not just individual behavior change)
- Tool requirements emerging: discoverability, ease of use, broad adoption critical

**Participant Engagement Patterns:**
- Most substantive contributions: Jenny Cook (8 turns), Brandon Maughan (6 turns), Matt Hansen (6 turns), Bory Kea (5 turns)
- Quieter participants: David Sheridan, Joshua Lupton, Nathan Bahr, Abby Dotson  
- Note for future focus groups: Consider strategies to engage quieter voices more actively

**UTAUT Framework Mapping:**
- **Performance Expectancy**: Tool must demonstrably increase visibility, reduce time to find collaborators, improve match quality
- **Effort Expectancy**: Must be visually appealing ("legible, not just rows and cells"), easy to scan, not overwhelming, intuitive without training
- **Social Influence**: MOST discussed construct - broad adoption necessity emphasized repeatedly ("has to be adopted broadly," "important that other people use it")
- **Facilitating Conditions**: Need institutional support, leadership endorsement, champion users, integration with existing workflows

### Key Context

**Institutional Setting**: OHSU Department of Emergency Medicine experiencing research in isolated silos creating: (1) missed academic advancement opportunities for junior faculty/residents/students, (2) inefficient matching of needs with expertise/resources, (3) duplicated efforts across teams.

**Leadership Transition**: Craig Newgard (former research head with significant P&T committee influence) recently departed. Matt Hansen is new research leadership, creating transitional period requiring new systematic coordination approaches.

**Institutional Memory**: Jenny Cook (19 years in department) provides crucial historical perspective on evolution from small focused group to large diverse research portfolio.

**Study Constraints**: No participant incentives allowed, virtual-only format required, scheduling across academic calendars presents challenges.

**Mentor Guidance (January 30, 2026)**: Jaime Jordan recommended study authors not participate as focus group members to maintain research integrity. She will join one additional focus group as observer to assist with data gathering and can provide input if critical gaps emerge in discussion. Suggested expanding leadership focus group to include Dave Jones, Lauren Sigman/Bri Miller, and APDs to capture student/residency leadership perspective.

### Secondary Aims

- Increase department-wide awareness of ongoing research projects
- Increase resident and medical student participation in research by 30%
- Improve perceived access to departmental research resources  
- Achieve high user satisfaction with developed tool (70%+ rating useful/very useful)
- Maintain active engagement with 60%+ department members logging in at least once, 50% within 1 year

### Qualitative Analysis Approach
**Multi-Layered Analytical Strategy:**
1. **Initial Inductive Coding** (Pure CGT): Let themes emerge organically from data without imposing predetermined frameworks, respecting constructivist grounded theory principles
2. **Deductive Mapping to UTAUT Framework**: After emergent coding, map themes to UTAUT constructs (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions) to understand technology acceptance factors
3. **Cross-Cutting Analysis**: Examine patterns across different question types (opening → transition → key → UTAUT → closing) to identify tensions, contradictions, and areas of consensus
4. **Stakeholder-Specific Pattern Identification**: Recognize perspectives unique to each stakeholder group (leadership vs. junior faculty vs. trainees)
5. **Validation**: Check themes against raw data to ensure interpretations are grounded in participant language and meaning

**Analytical Process Documentation:**
Created comprehensive analytical audit trail documenting complete coding journey:
- Initial reading with first impressions and questions
- Open coding: Line-by-line analysis with 150+ initial codes and analytical memos written during coding
- Six detailed analytical memos exploring emerging patterns ("The Craig Question," "The Engagement Paradox," "Generators vs. Finders," etc.)
- Focused coding: Grouping 150+ initial codes into 8 preliminary categories
- Axial coding: Mapping relationships and connections between categories
- Theoretical integration: Specific decisions about theme construction and organization
- UTAUT mapping: Deductive analysis layer connecting emergent themes to technology acceptance constructs
- Quality assessment: Evaluation using Lincoln & Guba trustworthiness criteria (credibility through prolonged engagement and thick description, transferability through rich contextual description, dependability through transparent audit trail, confirmability through linking interpretations to evidence)

**Key Methodological Strengths:**
- Systematic documentation enables replication and peer review of analytical decisions
- Transparency about researcher position and potential biases (Steve as insider/department member)
- Member checking planned for Phase 3 to validate interpretations
- Multiple data sources (9 participants with varying perspectives) enhance credibility
- Thick description and detailed quotes support transferability assessment

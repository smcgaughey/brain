## Project Summary

12-year retrospective cohort study (July 2013-July 2025) of 3,493 pediatric ED patients (523 ASD, 2,970 controls) examining restraint use patterns. This represents the largest analysis of restraint use in ASD patients in ED settings and the first to provide comprehensive age-stratified analysis. Key findings: ASD patients experience 2.6-fold higher odds of physical restraint overall with dramatic age-dependent escalation (no difference ages 5-8; 3-fold higher odds in adolescents >12 years), while chemical restraint remains consistently elevated 1.7-fold across all developmental stages. Study reveals concerning antipsychotic medication use patterns (34.0% vs 19.0%) and provides critical data for developing age-stratified, autism-informed emergency care protocols.

## Current Status

**✅ UNDER REVIEW** (as of January 16, 2026)

Successfully completed all editor-requested formatting changes and resubmitted January 12, 2026. Manuscript passed editorial screening and entered peer review January 16, 2026. Now awaiting reviewer feedback.

## Key Decisions

- **October 2025**: Decided against Pediatric Emergency Care (no brief report option)
- **November 2025**: Considered AJEM Brief Report format but pivoted to JADD for autism-focused audience
- **November 2025**: Implemented Hoffman et al. chemical restraint definition (diphenhydramine, lorazepam, olanzapine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine via parenteral/rapidly-absorbed oral routes)
- **November 2025**: Finalized age stratification: 5-8, 9-12, >12 years (developmentally-based, supported by Picci & Scherf two-hit model)
- **December 2025**: Standardized person-first language ("pediatric patients with ASD" vs "ASD patients")
- **January 2026**: Chose JADD over AJEM for developmental disorders journal audience sensitivity

## Activity Log

- **2026-02-09:** ASD Restraints - UNDO last update. That update about Clinical Pediatrics resubmission was for the wrong project. ASD Restraints is still under review at JADD with no changes.
- **2026-02-09:** ASD prescribing - resubmitted to Clinical Pediatrics on Feb 9 after addressing editorial requests (added educational objectives, completed authorship form). Received confirmation of editorial review. Manuscript ID: CLP-BR-26-081. Expected timeline: 3-6 weeks for reviewer assignment, then additional 3-6 weeks for decision. Estimated first decision: April-May 2026.
- **2026-02-04:** ASD Restraints Research Project - Correction: the "revision-requested" status was a test update and did not actually occur. The paper is currently submitted and awaiting feedback from the journal. Status should be under-review.

## Notes

### Methodology Highlights
- **Chemical restraint definition**: Adapted from Hoffman et al. (Hospital Pediatrics 2024) achieving 100% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity. Includes: diphenhydramine (IV/IM/PO), lorazepam (IM/PO), olanzapine (IM/ODT), haloperidol (IM only), chlorpromazine (IM only)
- **Physical restraint**: Based on behavioral restraint counts from clinician order timestamps (not nursing flowsheet documentation)
- **Age stratification rationale**: Developmentally-based groups align with prior literature (Kouo et al.) and developmental frameworks (Piaget, Picci & Scherf)
- **Statistical approach**: Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for sex, race, ED length of stay (variables with significant baseline differences p<0.05)
- **Control group**: Psychiatric patients without ASD (not general ED population) - methodologically stronger comparison

### Key Findings - Statistical Details
- **Overall restraint**: Any restraint 47.0% ASD vs 33.5% controls (aOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.46-2.13, p<0.001)
- **Physical restraint overall**: 14.1% ASD vs 5.9% controls (aOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.95-3.48, p<0.001)
  - Ages 5-8: No difference (aOR 0.76, p=0.639)
  - Ages 9-12: Elevated (aOR 2.19, p=0.004)
  - Ages >12: Dramatically elevated (aOR 3.25, p<0.001)
- **Chemical restraint**: 43.0% ASD vs 31.8% controls (aOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.43-2.08, p<0.001)
  - Consistently elevated across ALL age groups
- **Antipsychotic use**: 34.0% ASD vs 19.0% controls (p<0.001)
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Strict IV/IM definition yielded similar results, confirming robustness

### Clinical Significance
Novel age-dependent pattern discovery: Physical restraint risk escalates specifically during adolescence (not in younger children), while chemical restraint elevated consistently. This finding suggests need for age-stratified, ASD-specific de-escalation protocols aligned with EIIC/TREKK guidelines. Study represents critical evidence gap filling for autism-informed emergency care protocol development.

### Journal Selection Rationale
JADD selected over AJEM for:
1. Autism/developmental disorders specialty audience more sensitive to person-first language and community perspectives
2. Better alignment with implications for autism-specific interventions
3. Brief Report format accommodates comprehensive findings while maintaining focus
4. Peer reviewers with autism expertise will strengthen manuscript

### Editor Feedback & Revision Success
Editor required standard JADD formatting compliance before peer review (structured abstract, reference formatting, figure/table placement, font sizes, anonymous response document). All changes were formatting-only with no content revisions requested, suggesting strong initial editorial assessment. **Manuscript successfully passed editorial screening and entered peer review within 4 days of resubmission** - positive indicator of manuscript quality and editor satisfaction with revisions.

### Technical Documentation
- **Primary analysis script**: 20251117_Final_ASD_Restraint_Script.R
- **Forest plot development**: Multiple iterations using forestploter/forester packages
- **Publication-ready visualizations**: NEJM-style forest plots with hierarchical age categories, color-coded by restraint type (purple for physical, tan for chemical)
- **Data validation**: Age range 5.0-17.9 years, psychiatric inclusion criteria verified, medication routes cross-checked

# ED to PICU Tiered Admission System - Complete Research Summary

## Project Overview
**Study Type:** Quality Improvement Project  
**Setting:** Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)  
**Study Period:** Pre-intervention vs. Post-intervention cohort comparison  
**Total Sample Size:** 2,427 patients (Pre: 897, Post: 1,530)

## Study Team
- Pediatric Emergency Medicine physicians
- Pediatric ICU physician

## Background and Intervention

### Pre-Intervention Process
PED physician called PICU physician when they determined a patient needed PICU admission based on clinical judgment.

### Post-Intervention: Tiered System

**Tier 1 Criteria (Most Critically Ill)** - met ANY of the following:
- Intubated
- Received vasoactive medications
- Lactate > 6 mmol/L
- Hypotensive

**Tier 2 Criteria:**
- Determined to need PICU admission by PED physician
- Did not meet Tier 1 criteria

**Process Changes:**
- Tier 1: PED calls PICU immediately upon meeting Tier 1 status
- Goal: PICU opens bed and transports patient within 60 minutes of initial call
- Tier 2: Standard admission process

## Study Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis
Implementation of tiered system would improve ED to PICU admission times for Tier 1 patients.

### Secondary Hypotheses
1. Tier 1 patients would have improved outcomes:
   - Lower PICU length of stay
   - Fewer vasoactive hours
   - Lower mortality rates

2. Tier 2 patients might experience:
   - Slightly longer admission times (deprioritization)
   - Potentially worse outcomes

## Patient Demographics and Sample Distribution

### Overall Distribution
- **Pre-intervention:** 897 patients (37.0%)
  - Tier 1: 218 (24.3% of pre-intervention)
  - Tier 2: 679 (75.7% of pre-intervention)
  
- **Post-intervention:** 1,530 patients (63.0%)
  - Tier 1: 315 (20.6% of post-intervention)
  - Tier 2: 1,215 (79.4% of post-intervention)

### Tier 1 Patients
- Total: 533 across both periods
- Pre: n=218 (40.9%)
- Post: n=315 (59.1%)

### Tier 2 Patients
- Total: 1,894 across both periods
- Pre: n=679 (35.8%)
- Post: n=1,215 (64.2%)

## Primary Outcome: ED Length of Stay

### Tier 1 Patients (Pre vs Post)
- **Pre-intervention:**
  - Median: 1.91 hours
  - Mean: 2.53 hours (SD: 2.13)
  
- **Post-intervention:**
  - Median: 1.55 hours
  - Mean: 2.15 hours (SD: 1.63)

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Mann-Whitney U test: p=0.002 (SIGNIFICANT)
  - Median test: p=0.059 (not significant with Yates correction)
  - **Interpretation:** Significant reduction in ED LOS for Tier 1 patients, with median decrease of 0.36 hours (~22 minutes)

### Tier 2 Patients (Pre vs Post)
- **Pre-intervention:**
  - Median: 3.55 hours
  - Mean: 4.04 hours (SD: 2.19)
  
- **Post-intervention:**
  - Median: 3.77 hours
  - Mean: 4.28 hours (SD: 2.74)

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Mann-Whitney U test: p=0.100 (not significant)
  - Median test: p=0.092 (not significant)
  - **Interpretation:** No significant change in ED LOS for Tier 2 patients; hypothesis of deprioritization NOT supported

## Key Process Measure: Bed Request to Depart ED Time

### Tier 1 Patients (Pre vs Post)
- **Pre-intervention:**
  - Median: 0.93 hours (56 minutes)
  - Mean: 1.14 hours (SD: 0.93)
  
- **Post-intervention:**
  - Median: 0.73 hours (44 minutes)
  - Mean: 0.98 hours (SD: 0.89)

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Mann-Whitney U test: p=0.017 (SIGNIFICANT)
  - Median test: p=0.036 (SIGNIFICANT)
  - **Interpretation:** Significant 12-minute median reduction in time from bed request to ED departure. This demonstrates improved efficiency in the PICU bed preparation and patient transport process.

### Tier 2 Patients (Pre vs Post)
- **Pre-intervention:**
  - Median: 1.55 hours
  - Mean: 1.73 hours (SD: 0.97)
  
- **Post-intervention:**
  - Median: 1.58 hours
  - Mean: 1.93 hours (SD: 1.41)

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Mann-Whitney U test: p=0.102 (not significant)
  - Median test: p=0.421 (not significant)
  - **Interpretation:** No significant change

## Secondary Outcomes: Hospital and PICU Length of Stay

### Hospital LOS - Tier 1 (Pre vs Post)
- Pre: Median 5.12 days, Mean 9.52 days (SD: 13.49)
- Post: Median 5.00 days, Mean 8.66 days (SD: 11.94)
- **Statistical test:** p=0.596 (NOT significant)

### Hospital LOS - Tier 2 (Pre vs Post)
- Pre: Median 2.96 days, Mean 4.70 days (SD: 5.62)
- Post: Median 3.08 days, Mean 5.98 days (SD: 16.30)
- **Statistical test:** p=0.196 (NOT significant)

### PICU LOS - Tier 1 (Pre vs Post)
- Pre: Median 1.76 days, Mean 5.40 days (SD: 10.66)
- Post: Median 1.93 days, Mean 4.56 days (SD: 7.45)
- **Statistical test:** p=0.377 (NOT significant)

### PICU LOS - Tier 2 (Pre vs Post)
- Pre: Median 1.08 days, Mean 2.27 days (SD: 3.74)
- Post: Median 1.12 days, Mean 2.88 days (SD: 12.11)
- **Statistical test:** p=0.445 (NOT significant)

**Interpretation:** No significant differences in hospital or PICU LOS for either tier, suggesting that faster ED admission times did not translate to shorter overall hospital stays.

## Secondary Outcome: Vasoactive Hours

### Tier 1 Patients (Pre vs Post)
**Note:** Only 22.3% of Tier 1 patients (119/533) had vasoactive data
- Pre: n=46, Median 42.2 hours, Mean 106.6 hours (SD: 174.7)
- Post: n=73, Median 42.7 hours, Mean 89.9 hours (SD: 122.9)
- **Statistical test:** p=0.983 (NOT significant)

### Tier 2 Patients (Pre vs Post)
**Note:** Only 4.2% of Tier 2 patients (80/1,894) had vasoactive data
- Pre: n=23, Median 38.5 hours, Mean 74.0 hours (SD: 103.3)
- Post: n=57, Median 35.2 hours, Mean 93.2 hours (SD: 159.9)
- **Statistical test:** p=0.928 (NOT significant)

**Interpretation:** No significant differences in vasoactive medication duration. High missing data rate (77.7% for Tier 1, 95.8% for Tier 2) limits interpretation.

## Critical Outcome: Mortality

### Tier 1 Mortality - Any Time Point
- Pre-intervention: 36/218 (16.5%)
- Post-intervention: 53/315 (16.8%)
- **Chi-square test:** p=0.924 (NOT significant)

### Tier 1 Mortality - Within 30 Days of ED Arrival
- Pre-intervention: 22/218 (10.1%)
- Post-intervention: 28/315 (8.9%)
- **Chi-square test:** p=0.640 (NOT significant)

### Tier 2 Mortality - Any Time Point
- Pre-intervention: 41/679 (6.0%)
- Post-intervention: 58/1,215 (4.8%)
- **Chi-square test:** p=0.236 (NOT significant)

### Tier 2 Mortality - Within 30 Days of ED Arrival
- Pre-intervention: 4/679 (0.6%)
- Post-intervention: 6/1,215 (0.5%)
- **Chi-square test:** p=0.784 (NOT significant)

**Interpretation:** No significant changes in mortality rates for either tier at any time point. Hypothesis of improved mortality with faster admission times was NOT supported.

## Tier Comparisons (Within Time Periods)

### Pre-Intervention: Tier 1 vs Tier 2
- **ED LOS:** Tier 1 significantly shorter (1.91 vs 3.55 hrs, p<0.001)
- **Hospital LOS:** Tier 1 significantly longer (5.12 vs 2.96 days, p<0.001)
- **PICU LOS:** Tier 1 significantly longer (1.76 vs 1.08 days, p<0.001)
- **Bed Request to Depart:** Tier 1 significantly shorter (0.93 vs 1.55 hrs, p<0.001)

### Post-Intervention: Tier 1 vs Tier 2
- **ED LOS:** Tier 1 significantly shorter (1.55 vs 3.77 hrs, p<0.001)
- **Hospital LOS:** Tier 1 significantly longer (5.00 vs 3.08 days, p<0.001)
- **PICU LOS:** Tier 1 significantly longer (1.93 vs 1.12 days, p<0.001)
- **Bed Request to Depart:** Tier 1 significantly shorter (0.73 vs 1.58 hrs, p<0.001)

**Interpretation:** Appropriate patient stratification - sicker patients (Tier 1) had faster ED throughput but longer hospital/PICU stays, consistent with greater illness severity.

## Statistical Methods
- **Continuous variables:** Mann-Whitney U tests and Independent-Samples Median Tests
- **Categorical variables:** Chi-square tests with Yates continuity correction for 2x2 tables
- **Significance level:** Î±=0.05
- **Software:** SPSS (version not specified)

## Key Findings Summary

### Supported Hypotheses
1. â **Tier 1 ED LOS reduction:** Significant decrease (median 22 minutes, p=0.002)
2. â **Tier 1 bed request to departure reduction:** Significant decrease (median 12 minutes, p=0.017)

### Unsupported Hypotheses
1. â **Tier 1 PICU LOS reduction:** No significant change (p=0.377)
2. â **Tier 1 vasoactive hours reduction:** No significant change (p=0.983)
3. â **Tier 1 mortality reduction:** No significant change (p=0.640 for 30-day mortality)
4. â **Tier 2 time worsening:** No significant change in ED LOS (p=0.100) or bed request time (p=0.102)
5. â **Tier 2 outcome worsening:** No significant changes in any outcomes

## Clinical Significance

### Successful Improvements
- **Process efficiency:** The intervention successfully reduced ED throughput time for the most critically ill patients by implementing a structured, objective triage system
- **Bed preparation:** Faster bed request to departure times suggest improved PICU responsiveness
- **Maintained safety:** No adverse impact on Tier 2 patients despite prioritization of Tier 1 patients

### Lack of Outcome Improvement
Despite faster ED times, the intervention did not demonstrate:
- Reduced hospital or PICU length of stay
- Reduced duration of vasoactive medication use
- Reduced mortality rates

**Possible explanations:**
1. The magnitude of time savings (22 minutes median) may be insufficient to impact overall clinical outcomes
2. Other factors beyond ED admission time may be more influential on patient outcomes
3. Study may be underpowered to detect smaller outcome differences
4. Patient acuity and underlying disease severity may override the benefit of faster admission

## Study Strengths
1. Large sample size (2,427 patients)
2. Objective, reproducible criteria for patient stratification
3. Multiple validated outcome measures
4. Appropriate non-parametric statistical methods
5. Pre-post design with comparable time periods

## Study Limitations
1. **Missing data:** High percentage of missing vasoactive hours data (77.7% Tier 1, 95.8% Tier 2)
2. **Study design:** Non-randomized QI project, potential for confounding
3. **Single-center:** Findings may not generalize to other institutions
4. **Temporal confounding:** Other practice changes may have occurred between periods
5. **Sample size calculation:** Unknown if powered adequately for secondary outcomes
6. **Heterogeneity:** Large standard deviations suggest significant patient variability

## Data Completeness
- **ED LOS:** 100% complete
- **Hospital LOS:** 99.8% Tier 1, 99.7% Tier 2
- **PICU LOS:** 100% complete
- **Bed Request to Depart:** 98.5% Tier 1, 99.1% Tier 2
- **Vasoactive Hours:** 22.3% Tier 1, 4.2% Tier 2
- **Mortality:** 100% complete

## Next Steps for Manuscript Development
1. Literature review on ED crowding and PICU outcomes
2. Detailed description of implementation process
3. Balancing measures and sustainability data
4. Cost-effectiveness analysis (if available)
5. Discussion of why process improvements didn't translate to outcome improvements
6. Future directions for research

## Manuscript Target Considerations
- QI-focused journals (BMJ Quality & Safety, Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety)
- Pediatric emergency medicine journals (Pediatric Emergency Care, Academic Emergency Medicine)
- Critical care journals (Pediatric Critical Care Medicine)
- Emphasize process improvement success and lessons learned about outcome measures in QI

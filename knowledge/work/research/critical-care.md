## Project Summary
Multi-site retrospective descriptive study examining critical care billing "capture rates" (CC-eligible encounters billed as critical care / total CC-eligible encounters) across three Oregon emergency departments over 121 months (November 2015-November 2025). Study characterizes differences between academic (Marquam Hill) and community sites (AHPL, HMC) with approximately 50,390 eligible encounters and 243 providers. Employs visual storytelling approach with provider-level variability analysis using "spaghetti plots." 

## Study Aims

**PRIMARY AIM:**
Characterize critical care billing capture rates across three emergency departments over 121 months (November 2015 - November 2025).

**SECONDARY AIMS:**
1. Identify time periods when significant changes in capture rates occurred using Statistical Process Control methodology
2. Quantify provider-level variation in capture rates within each hospital
3. Describe patient demographics and clinical characteristics associated with critical care billing
4. Describe billing capture patterns across hospital types to provide context for institutional benchmarking (without formal statistical comparison)

**Note:** Intervention approach abandoned. Study is purely descriptive per Craig's guidance. Secondary aim #4 carefully avoids formal academic vs. community comparison due to unmeasured confounding (Craig's caution). Charlson Comorbidity Index will describe patient populations, not adjust for cross-institutional comparisons.

## Current Status
Finalized study aims as purely descriptive (February 3, 2026). Emailed Rochelle Fu for statistical consultation. Data pull scheduled for February 6, 2026. Preliminary analysis completed on 50,390 encounters showing OHSU improvement from 39.5% (Phase 1) to 74.7% (Phase 4) with major transitions at Feb 2017, Aug 2020, Sep 2023. Community hospitals stable at 80-90%. Massive provider variation documented (25-100% range at OHSU). Created 16 NEJM-style figures, 3 R analysis scripts, comprehensive data dictionary. Moving forward with final data collection.

## Key Decisions
- **May 2025**: Craig Newgard agrees to serve as senior author; emphasizes descriptive "visual storytelling" approach over complex statistical modeling
- **May 2025**: Expanded from single-site intervention study to multi-site descriptive landscape characterization based on mentor guidance
- **Late 2025**: Preliminary data analysis reveals academic site improvements preceded June 2024 template intervention
- **Late 2025**: Study reframed as primarily descriptive analysis of CC billing patterns across ED types rather than intervention effectiveness study
- **January 2026**: Finalized methodology prioritizing simple visual analysis with provider-level variability ("spaghetti plots") per Craig's preference for feasibility
- **February 2026**: Finalized four secondary aims as purely descriptive. Abandoned intervention approach. Craig cautioned against formal academic vs community statistical comparison due to unmeasured confounding. Charlson will describe populations only, not adjust comparisons.

## Activity Log

- **2026-02-13:** critical-care - CONFIRMED: Paper is in-preparation, NOT under review. Has not been written or submitted. Team meeting today Feb 13 with Rochelle Fu, Craig Newgard, Obert, and John to finalize analysis plan. Target submission in 3-4 weeks (early-mid March 2026). Status: in-preparation.
- **2026-02-10:** critical-care - CORRECTION: Set status to in-preparation, not under-review. Paper has not been written or submitted. Currently in data analysis planning phase. Blocked until after Friday 2/13 team meeting with Rochelle Fu, Craig Newgard, Obert, and John Organic-Lee to discuss data elements and analysis plan.
- **2026-02-10:** critical-care - Status correction: paper has NOT been written or submitted. Status should be in-preparation/data-analysis phase, not revision-requested. Meeting scheduled Friday Feb 13 with Rochelle Fu, Craig Newgard, Obert, and John Organic-Lee to discuss data analysis and data elements. No actionable writing work until after that meeting. → _Status: under-review_
- **2026-02-09:** Critical Care Billing - Craig responded with comments: endorses overall approach as "pretty solid". Key feedback: (1) confirm disposition covers ED and inpatient including mortality, (2) add ICU stay variable to show many CC patients not admitted to ICU, (3) add procedure codes to describe intervention/resuscitation types, (4) keep complexity simple with ESI + CCI for generalizability, (5) CCI is reasonable for ED patients. Craig wants to be part of the Rochelle Fu meeting - scheduling for Thursday 2/13 or Friday 2/14. Timeline: data pull Feb 2026, manuscript draft end of Feb/March. TODO: schedule meeting with Craig + Rochelle for Thu/Fri this week, update data pull to include ICU stay and procedure codes variables.
- **2026-02-04:** Critical Care Billing Capture Rate Study - Received data dump from Skylar and began processing. Data shows promising results with large shifts in baseline critical care billing percentages. Emailed various ED leaders to get feedback on the data - hoping discussion will help identify modifiable factors that led to differences in critical care billing. Also emailed statistician Rochelle Fu to set up a meeting for advice on analysis plan. Currently in a holding pattern awaiting feedback from both ED colleagues and Rochelle before moving forward. → _Status: revision-requested_
- **2026-02-03:** CC billing - Finalized study aims Feb 3, 2026. Four secondary aims: (1) temporal SPC analysis identifying change points, (2) quantify provider variation within hospitals, (3) describe patient demographics and characteristics, (4) describe hospital patterns for benchmarking WITHOUT formal statistical comparison. Purely descriptive study, abandoned intervention approach. Craig cautioned against academic vs community comparison due to unmeasured confounding. Charlson describes populations only, not for adjustment. Emailed Rochelle Fu for statistical consultation. Updated data dictionary and project summary with final aims.
- **2026-02-03:** CC billing project - test update via CLI
- **2026-02-03:** FINALIZED STUDY AIMS - Purely descriptive approach, four secondary aims established. No intervention analysis. Craig's caution regarding academic vs community comparison respected. Charlson describes populations only. Updated data dictionary and project summary. Rochelle Fu emailed for statistical consultation.
- **2026-02-03:** Critical Care Billing - Completed comprehensive preliminary and SPC analysis. Analyzed 50,390 encounters (OHSU 34,350, HMC 8,954, AHP 7,086) from Nov 2015-Nov 2025. Major findings: OHSU improved from 39.5% baseline (Phase 1) to 74.7% current (Phase 4) with transitions at Feb 2017, Aug 2020, Sep 2023. Community hospitals stable 80-90%. Patient characteristics: CC billed patients more severe (ESI 2.12 vs 2.22, Charlson 4.58 vs 4.17) but similar LOS (9.5 vs 9.4 hrs). Massive OHSU provider variation (25-100%). Generated 16 NEJM-style publication figures including phase-specific SPC charts. Created 3 R analysis scripts. Final data pull scheduled Feb 6. Need to document interventions at phase transition dates. Target submission March 2026 to Academic Emergency Medicine.
- **2026-02-03:** Critical care billing - received billing data from Skyler, planning to review on 2/3

## Notes

### Methodology Evolution
Project underwent significant transformation from intervention-focused design to primarily descriptive analysis. Craig's guidance emphasized keeping approach "feasible and not too complicated," focusing on "telling stories via pictures" rather than complex statistical modeling. Preliminary data showing academic site improvement preceded June 2024 template intervention reinforced wisdom of descriptive approach. Final pivot: completely abandoned intervention narrative in favor of pure descriptive characterization.

### Critical Care Eligibility Criteria
Comprehensive criteria established encompassing: ESI Level 1, critical procedures (CPR, intubation, cardioversion, pacing, CPT 99291), ICU admissions from ED, critical medications (35 high-acuity drugs including vasopressors, antiarrhythmics, thrombolytics, sedation with specific route requirements), and critical orders (transfusions, respiratory care, restraints, ventilators). Detailed in comprehensive data dictionary with clinical rationale documented.

### Primary Outcome & Secondary Aims
**Primary Aim**: Characterize critical care billing capture rates across three EDs over 121 months

**CC Capture Rate** = (CC-eligible encounters billed as critical care) / (Total CC-eligible encounters) × 100

**Secondary Aims** (finalized February 3, 2026):
1. Temporal pattern analysis using SPC methodology (identify change points)
2. Provider-level variation quantification within each hospital
3. Patient characteristics description (demographics, severity, complexity)
4. Cross-institutional pattern description for benchmarking (NO formal comparison)

### Key Variables
**Essential (Tier 1)**: Site, date, provider ID, CC eligibility flag, final E&M codes (99281-99285, 99291-99292), basic demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity)
**Important (Tier 2)**: ESI level, insurance type, length of stay, discharge disposition, provider type (attending/resident/APP)
**Patient Complexity**: Charlson Comorbidity Index (calculated from ICD-10 codes with 12-month lookback period) + ESI level - used to DESCRIBE populations, not adjust cross-site comparisons

### Outstanding Methodological Questions
1. ~~Are essential data elements missing from current variable list?~~ RESOLVED - comprehensive data dictionary completed
2. ~~Is Charlson Comorbidity Index appropriate for ED patients?~~ RESOLVED - using 12-month lookback, will describe populations only
3. ~~Does overall approach align with Craig's vision?~~ RESOLVED - purely descriptive per Craig's guidance
4. Need to document specific interventions/changes at three OHSU phase transition dates

### Expected Findings (Confirmed by Preliminary Data)
Community sites (AHP 89.8%, HMC 80.3%) maintain substantially higher CC billing capture rates than academic site (OHSU overall 58.6%, but improved from 39.5% baseline to 74.7% current). Massive provider variability confirmed at OHSU (25-100% range). Four distinct temporal phases identified at OHSU with major transitions at Feb 2017, Aug 2020, and Sep 2023. Patient characteristics show CC-billed encounters have more severe ESI (2.12 vs 2.22) and higher Charlson scores (4.58 vs 4.17) but similar length of stay (9.5 vs 9.4 hours).

### Publication Strategy
Target: Applied Clinical Informatics or Academic Emergency Medicine. Strength lies in honest descriptive characterization of CC billing landscape across ED types with unprecedented provider-level granularity. Novel findings include community sites outperforming academic center, sustained massive provider-level variability, and four-phase temporal evolution at academic site. Multi-site descriptive approach with 121-month timespan and 50K+ encounters rare in literature. Visual storytelling emphasis with 16 publication-quality figures.

## Core Research Question

How should clinicians adapt their communication practices to work effectively with audio-only AI ambient scribes, particularly in emergency department settings?

## The Problem

Current commentary on AI scribes focuses heavily on efficiency metrics, accuracy rates, and burnout reduction while largely ignoring a fundamental communication challenge: AI scribes interpret and organize clinical conversations using only audio input, lacking the visual and contextual information that human scribes naturally access. This creates a critical gap in how clinicians should communicate with these systems.

### Key Gaps Identified:
- **Sparse practical guidance:** Implementation focuses on technical aspects (starting recording, retrieving notes) rather than communication skills
- **Risk of information loss:** Schiff (2025) warned AI scribes risk "driving out the chitchat" - filtering relational and contextual information that serves clinical purposes
- **Unaddressed fidelity concerns:** What happens when documentation systems cannot see what clinicians see?

## Theoretical Foundation

The manuscript grounds the communication challenge in established communication theory:

### Primary Frameworks:

1. **Clark & Brennan's Grounding Theory (1991):**
   - Effective communication requires building "common ground" through shared context
   - Medium constraints include visibility and copresence
   - AI scribes operate with audibility alone - when visual channels disappear, verbal channels must compensate

2. **Clark & Krych's Empirical Evidence (2004):**
   - Lego construction task experiments showed removing visual access doubled task time
   - Prerecorded instructions without feedback greatly increased errors
   - Speakers must verbalize information otherwise conveyed through observation

3. **Clinical Parallel - I-PASS Handoff Protocol:**
   - Structured verbal framework reduced medical errors and preventable adverse events (Starmer et al., 2014)
   - Making implicit information explicit improves accuracy and safety
   - Proven clinical precedent for structured communication approaches

## The Novel Contribution: Verbal Anchoring Framework

**Verbal anchoring** = providing explicit verbal markers that establish context, temporal boundaries, and information categories for audio-only documentation systems.

### Three Types of Anchors:

1. **Temporal Anchors:** Clarify when information occurred/applies
   - Prevents historical data from being misattributed to current encounter
   - Example: "On review of outpatient labs from yesterday, the hemoglobin was 8.2"

2. **Category Anchors:** Clarify where information belongs in note structure
   - Compensates for AI's inability to see transitions (bedside → computer)
   - Example: "On physical exam..." or "Regarding the assessment..."

3. **Action Anchors:** Clarify what clinician is currently doing
   - Makes invisible activities explicit
   - Example: "Reviewing the chest X-ray obtained this morning..."

### Three-Phase Workflow:

1. **Chart Preparation:** Brief anchoring creates explicit temporal boundaries before patient encounter

2. **Clinical Dialogue:** 
   - Summarize temporal sequences aloud with patient confirmation
   - Discuss differential diagnosis and reasoning directly with patient
   - Supports shared decision-making while recording medical decision-making

3. **Documentation Transitions:**
   - Dictate exam findings immediately on leaving room
   - Contextualize diagnostic review
   - Captures details while fresh

## The Reframing: "The Blind Scribe" Mental Model

**Key Insight:** Working with an AI scribe is like working with a highly competent human scribe who cannot see.

This reframing makes the challenge tractable - clinicians intuitively understand how to adapt communication for someone lacking visual access to shared information. The question becomes not "How do I use this software?" but "How do I communicate with a capable colleague who cannot see what I am doing?"

## Constraint as Opportunity

The manuscript argues that verbalizing context may actually improve clinical communication beyond documentation:

- **Verification:** Summarizing timelines aloud helps catch discrepancies, invites patient corrections
- **Transparency:** Verbalizing reasoning models transparent decision-making, supports patient participation
- **Thoroughness:** Systematically narrating findings reduces chance of omitting important observations
- **Agency:** Clinicians control what is captured rather than hoping AI infers correctly

## Limitations & Future Directions

The manuscript explicitly acknowledges:

1. **Empirical gaps:** Framework arises from early clinical experience and theoretical grounding, not controlled evaluation
2. **Individual variation:** Communication style differences will require adaptation
3. **Scope limitations:** Addresses clinician-side communication but not system design, accuracy, or bias
4. **Open questions:** Whether verbal anchoring improves documentation quality, reduces errors, or affects outcomes remains empirical

## Current Manuscript Status

**Theoretical Foundation:** Recently strengthened through systematic integration of:
- Media Richness Theory (channel capacity for conveying information)
- Media Synchronicity Theory (conveyance vs. convergence distinction)
- Clinical communication protocols (I-PASS handoffs)

**Empirical Verification:** Completed systematic fact-checking of all claims and statistics, removing unverifiable data to maintain scientific integrity

**Key Revisions Completed:**
- Replaced unverifiable efficiency statistics with grounded theoretical claims
- Strengthened distinction between "conveyance" (where AI excels) and "convergence" (where AI struggles)
- Enhanced citation accuracy and empirical foundation
- Maintained practical applicability for clinical audiences

## Strategic Considerations

**Target Audience:** NEJM AI readers - mix of clinical informaticists, physician leaders, AI researchers

**Unique Value Proposition:** 
- First framework to systematically address clinician communication adaptation for AI scribes
- Bridges communication theory, clinical precedent, and practical ED experience
- Offers actionable guidance rather than just identifying problems

**Competitive Positioning:** Fills gap between technology-focused implementation guides and outcome-focused research

## Next Steps for Publication

1. Consider inclusive language review (e.g., "blind scribe" terminology)
2. Balance preservation of original author voice with theoretical strengthening
3. Ensure 1200-word limit compliance while maintaining compelling narrative
4. Consider empirical validation pathway for future research

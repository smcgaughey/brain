# Matt Hansen - Pediatric Trauma Intelligence (Feb 2026)

## Source
Email response from Matt Hansen, OHSU pediatric trauma liaison, received ~Feb 9, 2026 in preparation for TSMEAC Trauma Subcommittee meeting.

## Key Points

### Statewide Initiatives
- Nothing statewide that Matt is aware of — directed to **EMSC committee** (Rachel Ford, program manager; Carl Eriksson and Justin Cook on committee) as the better source
- OHSU has an internal **pediatric readiness committee/workgroup** across OHSU sites covering pediatric trauma as a component — does QI and simulation work
- New series of **pediatric trauma lectures** for Thailand project — PPT with video + quiz questions, relatively basic but potentially useful for rural/Level 3-4 trauma centers

### Pediatric Readiness / Accreditation Gaps
- Key contact: **Sandra Joachin** (OHSU ED nurse, PANDA transport work) for frontline perspective
- Major challenge: **pediatric ventilator management and post-intubation sedation** at general EDs — many don't know how to vent small kids, resort to bagging until PANDA arrives
- OHSU has worked with **Adventist** specifically on this gap
- This is a concrete pediatric readiness gap relevant to hospital accreditation standards discussion

### Transfers
- **60% of OHSU peds trauma volume are transfers**
- Generally go OK per Matt's experience
- No specific pain points identified

### OTR
- Matt doesn't interact with OTR, only local data
- Not a useful source for registry questions

### Volume Observation
- OHSU's peds trauma volume between two Level 1 centers is **lower than expected** based on state population
- Matt's hypothesis: local hospitals are managing cases themselves without transferring — cases that in other states might get transferred
- This has implications for whether those local hospitals have adequate pediatric capability for the cases they're keeping

## Action Items
- Connect with **Rachel Ford** (EMSC program manager) for statewide pediatric initiatives
- Connect with **Sandra Joachin** for frontline transfer/readiness perspective
- Follow up on the volume observation — potential quality/safety question about whether local hospitals retaining peds trauma cases have adequate pediatric readiness
